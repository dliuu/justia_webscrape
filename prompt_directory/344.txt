{'question': 'Can I negotiate with landlord to stay at my apartment after receiving a termination of lease?Hello. I received a termination of lease by landlord in July 2020. My lease if up Nov 2020. I have been looking for an apartment for months now and I cannot find. They want three times my salary. I recently got layed off because of covid 19 pandemic but have some savings. I am not sure what to do. My landlord gave us termination of lease just one year because they want to rent the apartment for more money. Thank you!', 'answer': 'There is always room for negotiations.  In any event, if you don&#039;t reach an agreement before your lease terminates, the landlord can&#039;t just lock you out but will have to commence a court case.  If the landlord won&#039;t give you time, the court may.'}
