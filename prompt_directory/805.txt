My name is on the deed i been paying for 10 yearswe were both originally on the deed but his name was removed when he went into the military and developed PTSD I have been paying the mortgage for many years and it was even refinanced with my income information', 'answer': 'It is not possible.  You would need to refinance.  However, as long as you pay, no one will care what name is on it.  The deed governs ownership so the property is yours.'}
