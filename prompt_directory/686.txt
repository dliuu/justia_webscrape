{'question': 'Can the bank sell my property if no Administrator  has been appointed?Before my father died , I was incorrectly added to the deed , “As Administrator” .  I have been working on obtaining Letters . The court appointed Administrator waived his rights as Admin and consented to allow me to become the Administrator.   I am now waiting for the Court to issue me Letters so that I can represent the Estate . The property is being foreclosed on .  Can the bank force a sale of my father’s property even when there is not a Court appointed Administrator?', 'answer': 'The bank has to follow certain procedures to obtain a judgment and the deed.  It depends on the jurisdiction.  The bank can petition the court as a creditor for appointment of an administrator and certain relief.'}
