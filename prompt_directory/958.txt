{'question': 'What can be done about a pile of junk that was left on a purchased property?I discovered it when looking at property I purchased in the fall. It looked mostly like old flower pots, unused landscaping materials and an old tire on a rim. I told the selling agent who assured me it would be removed before the closing. It took me the rest of the fall and into winter to move and had no reason to go out to that area until the other day and the junk is still there.', 'answer': 'Unfortunately there is little you can do once you closed on the purchase. While the contract likely had a requirement for the seller to deliver possession of the property vacant and broom clean, that obligation typically ends at the closing. Your contract might allow for this requirement to survive the closing. While that is unlikely, I would suggest reading the contract to see if that is the case.'}
