{'question': 'How do I start an arbitration action between myself as an owner against my condominium building which it requires?I attempted a civil lawsuit but the Court dismissed it saying the Court lacks subject matter Jurisdiction to hear an action and I must use mandatory arbitration.', 'answer': 'It looks like your remedies are governed by a mandatory arbitration clause. The organization named in the by-laws should have information in terms of filing fees, paperwork, etc. Large arbitration organizations, such as the American Arbitration Association, have online resources. Good luck'}
