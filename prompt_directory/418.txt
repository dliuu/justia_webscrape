{'question': 'I have a question regarding Bronx residents rights. My father passed in Oct. When him and I signed the lease 5 yearsagoManagement knew that I wont be on the lease but id be living there as I went with him to sign the lease. I&#039;ve done some research on squatters rights but iam unsure if it pertains to me. I&#039;d like to stay with the apartment but would like to advise management. This building is not Section 8 or NYCHA. These building are owned by individual Jewish folks who have been great to us so far. My question is, can I invoke &quot;squatters rights&quot; here in NYC (Bronx) ?  Or is this impossible?', 'answer': 'If the building is subject to Rent Stabilization or other rent regulation, you may be entitled to succession rights provided you lived with your farther for the required time before he passed. Even if that isnâ€™t the case, many landlords would be happy to keep on a good tenant'}
