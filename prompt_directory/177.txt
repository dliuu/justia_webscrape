{'question': 'is there a way to evict a family living in your basement without a lease and it is illegal to have tenants living therewe have a family that we told countless times to leave because we need the basement and they told us that theyre going to leave in a couple of months and they never leave and they are loud and dont respect rules of the house', 'answer': 'A large percentage of basement apartments are not legally permitted.  In order to determine if the basement apartment in your building is permitted, you can start by obtaining a copy of the Certificate of Occupancy. \n \nRegardless of whether the basement apartment is legal, a property owner has a right to bring an action to obtain possession of the premises from a non-owner family member.  Depending upon the circumstances, the owner may have to bring an ejectment action instead of a summary proceeding in Housing Court.'}
