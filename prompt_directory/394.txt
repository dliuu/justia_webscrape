{'question': 'can i break my lease for unresolved cockroach and bed bug infestation?Yes a tenant in the same building over a year ago had a very bad infestation. Management did not act quickly but said the tenant would not allow access. The policy here is to spray each apartment once a month. Consequently many of the apartment s are overrun with roaches. Because of Managements slow move to action and reluctance to take serious control by having each and every apartment sprayed the problem escalatedI I was told by a friend of the tenant that the roaches were running up the walls  over a year ago and were now  coming into his adjacent apartment.', 'answer': 'What happened last year isn&#039;t particularly relevant to your current question.  If the apartment is rendered uninhabitable because of conditions such as needed repairs or infestation, this can be considered a breach of the warranty of habitability leading to the constructive eviction of a tenant.  However, you must usually give the landlord proper notice and an opportunity to address the situation.  Whether the condition constitutes a breach of the warranty of habitability is fact intensive determination and can be answered definitely on a board like this.'}
