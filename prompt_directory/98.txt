{'question': 'My grandmother is 94y old, of sound mind, PR resident.  What is the average cost of drafting  &amp; filing a Living Will?She is in the process of selling her home. In the event she passes before home is sold, the proceeds of the sale would go to the heirs. \nAt which time then, the heirs would need to file to obtain these funds. Is there a way to avoid the legalities later, by drafting &amp; filing documents now while she is living.  Would a Living Will resolve the issue?  Would it be more extensive than that ? And what would the average cost of getting these papers drafted in Puerto Rico today be, to avoid issues later?', 'answer': 'Since your grandmother resides in Puerto Rico, your question would be better directed to attorneys in Puerto Rico instead of New York.  However, regardless of the jurisdiction, a living will does not address the disposition of property but merely the care of someone who may become incapacitated.'}
