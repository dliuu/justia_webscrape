{'question': 'If I put down a floor then I move can I remove itSaint Cloud, FL asked on November 7, 2020 in Real Estate Law for New York', 'answer': 'More specifics will need to be disclosed to better answer the question. Assuming that your situation concerns New York, usually, it depends what the lease says. Sometimes you have the obligation to return the premises in the same condition as existed when leased. Sometimes, the lease says you can leave the premises as it is with certain conditions to be met. If you made some structural changes to the premises consented by the landlord, and the lease is silent on what has to be done upon your departure, then discuss with the landlord and you may want to execute an addendum to the existing lease.'}
