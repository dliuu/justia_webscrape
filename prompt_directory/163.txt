{'question': 'can i use my security deposit as last months rent in long island?New York, NY asked on February 3, 2022 in Landlord - Tenant for New York', 'answer': 'Security deposits are intended to be available to pay for any damage to the apartment caused by the tenant before vacating.  Applying the security deposit to last month&#039;s rent would defeat that purpose and, therefore, is not appropriate.  That being said, landlords don&#039;t have many options to prevent tenants from  asking for the security deposit to be applied to last month&#039;s rent as it typically takes longer than that for a landlord to advance a case in Housing Court.'}
