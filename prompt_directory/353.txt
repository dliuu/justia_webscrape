{'question': 'Wanted to terminate my lease earlier because of financial hardship due to COVID -19!Due to the pandemic, I experience financial hardship. I tried to negotiate the rent but the landlord won&#039;t assist on that matter except using their hardship program which we did use the deposit to pay the month of September rent. I was looking at different alternatives and also to terminate my lease early. The landlord states that I will be responsible for the rent until the apartment is occupied by someone or pay a 3-month rent fee (closed to $12000), which will put our financial situation in jeopardy. After reading the lease several times. nothing stated anything of what they told me and not even a mention of early termination or notice! Can I leave a 30 days notice and not been penalized as they said?', 'answer': 'This seems funny coming from an attorney, but reach out to one immediately.  My office, and many others routinely handle this matters affordably.  Your landlord has certain responsibilities (and some rights).  There are ways to navigate this situation.  However, I would need more facts from you before I could give you a more solid answer/solution to your problem.'}
