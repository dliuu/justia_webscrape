{'question': 'Do I need lawyer assistance in completing a &quot;Tenancy deed with right of survivorship&quot; to add my wife to the deed?I own the home and want to add my wife to the deed. Do we need the assistance of a lawyer to have a &quot;joint tenancy of survivorship&quot;  done legally? We are completing the forms and I know it needs to be notarized but does it need lawyer approval?', 'answer': 'I second my colleagues comments and would add that in addition to the deed there are additional tax documents that generally need to be completed before a deed is accepted for filing.  Since issues with a questionable deed can cause problems down the road for title insurance reasons, it is probably best to have a local lawyer help you.'}
