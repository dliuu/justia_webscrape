{'question': 'Can I, as the landlord, serve a notice to vacate to my tenants who are on a month to month lease or do I need a lawyer?Also, where to find the way to deliver the notice according to my state rules would be greatly appreciated', 'answer': 'In New York, an individual owner is not required to have a lawyer prepare or serve predicate notices for a landlord/tenant case but the owner cannot personally serve these documents.  Although it may seem like a cost saver for an owner to skip a lawyer for preparation of a predicate notice, it often winds up costing more in lost time and unpaid rent when a case is later dismissed because of a technically defect in those initial papers that cause an entire case to be dismissed.'}
