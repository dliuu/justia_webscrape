{'question': 'Can my landlord require proof of my chronic illness to make a repair?The intercom and buzzer for my apartment hasn&#039;t worked in over a year.  My building management has claimed over the same year that they are waiting on a chip to replace the entire system.  In the interim, Ive requested an electrician look at the current system to see if a temporary solution can be achieved. \n \nI told my landlord that I live with a chronic illness that impacts my mobility at times, an that the lack of a working buzzer and intercom is a major inconvenience. \n \nThey are asking for proof of my chronic illness before they take action.  Am I required to provide them with proof?', 'answer': 'Call 311 to request an inspection for a housing violation.'}
