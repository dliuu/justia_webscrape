{'question': 'Can my landlord tell me to pay more money for past months rent because we are switching our lease from a year to 3 monthWe want to get out of lease early bc of covid and ability to afford rent because of loss of work.  Our landlord said no but said we can switch from a year lease to 3 months. They want to charge us $500 to even just start the paperwork and then $500 for June and July rent that we have already paid, as well as Augustâ€™s rent will be $500 more. Is this legal?', 'answer': 'Even with the havoc that the Covid crisis has created, generally tenants remain responsible for the remaining term of any unexpired leases.  If the landlord is willing to release you from the remaining term of your lease, it is not unusual to require a payment of some type.  Appears that basically your landlord is doing that but just calling it by a different name.'}
