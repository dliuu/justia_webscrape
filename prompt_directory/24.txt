{'question': 'As a home owner do I have to pay for broken damaged appliances caused by my tenant?I am a home owner and when my tenant moved in, all appliances including ceiling fan was in excellent working safe condition. Last summer I had to replace the ceiling fan because he was being too rough with it that the wires got disconnected. Now the oven door frame is broke (looks like it was ranked off the screws). He is very rough in the way he handles things. I need to know if he breaks these items due to his negligence, do I have to pay for repairs/replacement?', 'answer': 'Dear Queens Home Owner: \n \nOrdinarily, mere negligence (not gross) will not even help you in the recovery of monetary damages in a lawsuit in Small Claims Court. Your homeowner insurance may provide relief. \n \nGenerally, in an ordinary apartment residential rental, the landlord is always responsible for making repairs to appliances and maintaining the rented apartment in the same condition as when the tenant took over occupancy. Your service contracts may cover the expense of repairs. If not, you cannot draw down from the tenant&#039;s security deposit for repairs occasioned by the tenant&#039;s intentional destruction, before the tenant vacates the apartment. When you deal with a tenant moving out you must itemize the damages caused by the tenant, beyond ordinary wear and tear, in writing and do so within 14 days after the tenant moved out.  \n \nThere is an exception to the general rule. A landlord renting an entire single-family house to a tenant may use the lease as a means to shift the burden of repairs upon the tenant.'}
