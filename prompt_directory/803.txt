{'question': 'Does an easement appurtenant ends when the servient estate obtains title to the Dominant estate?Or in order for the merger doctrine to be applicable the dominant estate must obtain title to the servient estate?', 'answer': 'Title is taken by an individual or entity, not the land. If the same owner takes title to both the dominant and servient estates, then the easement is extinguished through the &quot;merger&quot; of the estates. I hope this helps answer your question.'}
