{'question': 'NYU students who rents a Village Apartment Impacted by CV19 Pandemic and Closure of NYU CampusI&#039;m an NYU undergraduate student who rents an apartment with 3 other classmates in the Village a couple of blocks from NYU Washington Square.  Due to CV19 pandemic, NYU has recently suspended classes for the rest of the semester and closed the campus and all dorms to students.  We rent our place close to campus from a private LL.  We&#039;ve now all returned to our homes outside of NYC and the apartment will remain vacant  (no need for it anymore).  We provided 1-month&#039;s rent as security deposit, paid a hefty broker&#039;s fee at lease signing and our parents acted as guarantors.  Do we have any ability to terminate the lease without risking additional liability going forward (the lease expires at the end of August) under NY State and Manhattan LL-T law.  Note that the lease itself doesn&#039;t have any type of liquidated damages clause (it&#039;s the standard RSA 2010 Lease form).', 'answer': 'It would be irresponsible to provide you with a definite answer to your question without reviewing your actual lease and rider(s); however, can provide you with general information about leasing in New York.  Unless a lease conditions the duration of the lease term on external events, like attending school, the duration is the term specified and a tenant is responsible for the full term of the lease.  If a tenant breaches the lease, a landlord has a duty to attempt to mitigate damages by attempting to re-let the apartment but the tenant and any guarantor remain liable for the rent until the lease expires or until a new tenant is found.'}
