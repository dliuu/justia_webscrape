{'question': 'Can I terminate an apt Lease me being the tenant?I am married but separated. I moved out of the apt my spouse stayed there. On the 2 (now 1 year remaining) year lease there is my name and her name. We used my credit.  \nI would like to terminate the lease or at the least take my name off that lease. Is this something I can do? and \nis it better if I am still married to do so or divorced? \n \nThank you!', 'answer': 'It really depends on the landlord.  If the landlord is willing to let you off of the lease and your ex is still paying then it shouldn&#039;t be a problem.  It&#039;s too bad you didn&#039;t work this out while going through the divorce.  You might do well to have an attorney negotiate with your landlord and ex wife (or her attorney).'}
