{'question': 'How do I obtain a &quot;Letter of Satisfaction&quot; for a mortgage that my name has been taken off of without my knowledge?My name is currently on the deed and all of the original mortgage finance papers filed with the state. My ex Husband did a loan modification without my knowledge and my name is not on that modification.', 'answer': 'I am not sure what your concern is.  You are on the deed, so you own the property.  If the old mortgage is still appearing, you can call that bank and get a satisfaction filed.  If you are not on the new mortgage you do not have to pay it, so it seems in your interest.  How your ex accomplished this is the issue.  Is there a divorce decree he was able to show allowing it, or did he forge your name?'}
