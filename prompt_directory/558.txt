How do I go about transferring this into.my name', 'answer': 'I&#039;m sorry for the loss of your brother. You could continue to await a response here in the Real Estate section, but you could also consider reposting in the Probate and Estate Planning categories. There&#039;s no guarantee all posts are picked up, but you might have better chances there. You mention that these instruments were executed in California - I do not work in this area of law, but it&#039;s possible you need the input of a California attorney there. Maybe if you reposted in Probate and Estate Planning in California as a starting point, an attorney with knowledge in these matters could hopefully pick up your question and direct you meaningfully. Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
