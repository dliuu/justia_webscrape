{'question': 'What is the normal cost of a real estate attorney in Albany NY for a home purchase?This is for an out of state buyer who is doing a first time purchase of a home in NY.  What should a buyer be asking when trying to determine the most cost effect way to hire a real estate attorney?', 'answer': 'The real estate attorneys here could give you the most meaningful input, but you&#039;re waiting for a reply and as a general matter, a good way to find out could be to contact attorneys and ask their fees. As with attorneys in any field, you could ask their area of focus, their experience, and other questions you could probably find posted on realtor&#039;s online resources. Sometimes the best thing to do might be to spend two minutes speaking with the attorney and rely on your instincts whether you would like to work with them for the brief transaction period. Also pull out a map and find out where the closing will take place - it won&#039;t generally make sense for an attorney to drive three hours to handle a closing. Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
