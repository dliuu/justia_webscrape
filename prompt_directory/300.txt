{'question': 'I bought a house with a &quot;friend&quot;, realizing too late I&#039;ve been manipulated. Can I &quot;break&quot; our agreement?I should have gotten a lawyer to represent my interests at the time, but our co-homeowner agreement seems very lopsided now. I don&#039;t want to sell or take on another mortgage, but I need some kind of relief from the onerous conditions she keeps imposing. These include limiting my privacy, personal space, &amp; autonomy in my own home, sharing  a very small house with her rotating guests &amp; tenants. It feels like a violation of my civil rights. Thank you for your thoughts.', 'answer': 'One option as a starting point could be to arrange a consult with an attorney to review the agreement. Without seeing that, it could be difficult for an attorney to advise meaningfully, solely based on general principles of contract law. Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
