{'question': 'Does my landlord have the right to give me 60 day notice due to esa dog visiting me with the owner?North Tonawanda, NY asked on February 18, 2021 in Animal / Dog Law and Landlord - Tenant for New York', 'answer': 'Iâ€™m not sure what type of notice you received. If you are doing something in violation of your lease, the normal process is to serve you with a Notice to Cure. That gives you a short time to correct the offending condition. A Notice to Terminate your lease would be inappropriate if this is the first time a dog was on the premises.'}
