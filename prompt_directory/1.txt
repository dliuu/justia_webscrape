{'question': 'Can I be sued personally for a property I purchased under an llc?I purchased a property under an llc. Unbeknownst to me the deed was fraudulent. I signed the deed back to the real owner. I did some repairs until I found out the deed was fraudulent. The real owner is now suing my llc and me personally for treble damages done to the property. Can they go after me personally? BTW the house was completely destroyed when we started cleaning and I have videos of the inside before I started repairs. FBI was on the case and saw I had nothing to do with it.', 'answer': 'There are circumstances in which the owner of an LLC could have personal liability... particularly if it is alleged there was fraud.  If you have been sued, you should immediately retain legal counsel as there are time limits to responding to litigation or a default judgment may be taken against you.'}
