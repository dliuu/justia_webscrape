{'question': 'Is it possible to back out of a lease for an apartment before you move in?I have recently signed a lease but have not moved in yet and Iâ€™ve been moved to part time at my job and will now not be able to afford it.', 'answer': 'You will need to speak with your landlord. Before you retain a lawyer and start any action out of blue, you can negotiate with him/her about terminating the lease agreement. The landlord may be entitled to a separate legal action to collect the money for your breach of the lease, but given the reason for your surrender, getting a judgement and enforcing the same will not be beneficial to the landlord. It&#039;s recommended you speak with him/her and minimize the monetary loss.'}
