{'question': 'Can my landlord involve relatives in ongoing issue?As per our oral agreement, rent should be collected on every 1st of the month. Tenants will inform the landlord over the phone that the rent is ready.  \nHowever, this month my landlord did not answer his phone on the 1st so I called again on the 2nd he answered and was rude but he was informed that the rent was ready. a few days later he called our relatives and told them he went over to our apartment and we don&#039;t want to pay the rent.  \n1. Can he involve other people although it is a month to month lease? \n2. Is it right what he is doing? \n3. Can i sue him for that?', 'answer': 'If the landlord make false statements about you, you may have a cause of action for libel or slander but difficult cases and damages are likely not to be worth the cost of litigating.'}
