{'question': 'Can I get back money for down payment on condo placed before the coronavirus?I signed a contract to purchase a condo in 2019 (before the coronavirus) and put a 10% down payment for the condo. However, after the coronavirus hit, my business took a very hard hit, and I am unable to pay for the amount of the condo. When I had purchased it, the plan was to pay for the condo in cash, however, now it is very hard for me to even get a mortgage. The contract has no mortgage clause because I had planned to pay in full in cash. Now I am unable to get a mortgage, and risk losing the full down payment I made (close to $74,000). Are there any other options? Thank you in advance.', 'answer': 'It depends upon the terms of your contract.  However, you need to be a tough guy to make things harder for the seller so you can get some back.'}
