{'question': 'In NY, who can file for probate of will? Is it only the executor or can a beneficiary (i.e. child of deceased) file?Need clarification about who must file for probate following a relative&#039;s death. Relative in question has multiple children and one of the children is named executor of will. However, I want to know if any beneficiaries in the will can initiate probate.', 'answer': 'Anyone can initiate probate.  Whoever has the original will is mandated to file it.  If they do not, there is a petition to compel production of the original will that starts the case.'}
