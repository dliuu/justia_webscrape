{'question': 'My daughter fell &amp; fractured her tibia. My bldg is asking what, where &amp; when it happened. Do they have the right to ask?I&#039;m not filing a claim. My daughter was playing with something she shouldn&#039;t have been so it was an unfortunate accident.', 'answer': 'They could assert that their right to request such information arises in their insurance coverage or standard operating procedures. It protects their interests if a claim should arise in the future. It also has the incidental benefit of serving the injured by establishing that an accident and injury occurred on such and such a date in such and such a manner. You indicate that you are not making a claim. However, I recommend that you make no further statements or admissions on public forums, other than statements related to inquiries about general information your seek. I wish your daughter a speedy and healthy recovery. Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
