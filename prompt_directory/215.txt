{'question': 'Landlords voided our lease without informing usHi! My roommate and I signed a lease together on August 31 for September 1 however we were told the apartment would not be ready until the 10th. We contacted them on Tuesday the 7th and were told that our lease cannot be allowed as it was double-sided. So we then resubmitted the lease. And we were told that our building management would get back to us for what date we could move in. We then called back today and we’re told that our lease is now voided because there is an issue with it and the apartment couldn’t be leased. We already paid our security deposit and 1 months rent and the landlords won’t give us any further information.', 'answer': 'It isn&#039;t clear from your post whether you have been dealing directly with the landlord or through a real estate agent/broker.  If you were dealing with a broker and have not received a fully executed copy of your lease, you probably don&#039;t have a binding contract yet.  If you do have a fully executed lease, the specific terms of that lease would set the terms upon the action the landlord can take to terminate the lease after it has been signed by all parties.'}
