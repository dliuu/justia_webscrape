{'question': 'Who gets the house if partners break up and both are on title?I haven&#039;t had income for a few years, would I be allowed on the title? Am I responsible for payments as a co signer then? We&#039;ve been together 12 years but been renting. Is common law still a thing in NY? I&#039;m female and he&#039;s male. I just need some advice before I sign papers. Thanks', 'answer': 'Possibly neither. \n \nDon&#039;t sign anything without speaking with counsel first and perhaps a quick review of documents at no charge. \n \nHave a free telephone consultation with counsel. \n \nPlease call me, any day or night, up until 11:00 pm. \n \nJack Mevorach, Esq.  \nMEVORACH.COM (resume) \n(516) 295-7655 \n \nJack'}
