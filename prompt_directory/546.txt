{'question': 'Is this considered harassment?These are three separate incidents with the super of the apartment building I live in that has made me feel uncomfortable \n \n1. Constantly asking me who is living with me or if I have anyone in my apartment (I am the only one on the lease, but my boyfriend visits a lot). However, the super stops me and asks about my living situation often, even though I express I live alone  \n \n2. Pretending he is mopping the floor so he can eavesdrop at my door (I witnessed him do this through the peephole of my apartment) \n \n3. Watching my interactions with my family in front of the building \n \n4. Raising his voice and insisting that I come to his apartment so we can discuss a “paper”. When I asked him what the conversation needed to be about he kept insisting that I come to his apartment \n \nThese are a few actions he has done which has caused me to feel uncomfortable. I have notified my broker and management of his behavior. However, I would like to know if these things are considered harassment?', 'answer': 'If the notification to management was not in writing, you need to do an email or letter.  You are handling it right.  It is not a case for a lawyer yet, but documenting problems with management will help make a case if things persist.'}
