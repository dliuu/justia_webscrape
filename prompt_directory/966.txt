{'question': 'What kind of lawyer do I need?  My single wide trailer burned down, no fault of my own! lI had been complaining to the landlord for months they would try to fix it, it was never right, he and His Drunk handyman put in bigger fuel jets and it burned twice as much fuel. a few days ago at bed time it went out, we hit the reset and a few minutes later the furnace went up in flames, we made it out but we lost everything. the owner just said good luck!  We need help!', 'answer': 'First find out if your loss is covered by insurance. If there was an insurance policy in effect for the premises, then the type of lawyer you would need would be a civil litigation lawyer versed in property and casualty claims. Thankfully, it looks like no one was injured. If there is a policy in effect, it&#039;s possible you might be able to resolve without a lawyer if you are able to work with their property damage adjuster. Good luck'}
