You appear to want to know if you can forward your dispute to the police, district attorney, or some other law enforcement agency.  Any citizen may forward their conflicts to a law enforcement agency; however, such agencies often will not involve themselves in matters they deem personal or private.  Shareholder disputes are often personal or private and the proper avenue for redress is the civil justice system, not the criminal justice system.  For example, a minority shareholder in a close corporation may bring a lawsuit against the other shareholders for breach of contract, among other claims.  They may also even pursue a dissolution of the corporation under theories of oppression.  These types of claims require a lawyer however.  Please contact a good New York lawyer who will help you.  Good luck.'}
