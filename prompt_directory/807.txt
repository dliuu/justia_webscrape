{'question': 'I am in court hearings with my neighbor. \n \nPlease tell me how much court proceedings cost.This is a civil court. This is a land issue. \nA neighbor wants to use my part of a property. There is no easement.', 'answer': 'One of the real estate attorneys here could answer your question in the best manner, but you await a reply for three days. It&#039;s unlikely that an attorney could give you a turnkey price based on the brief description provided. An attorney might want to set up a paid consult to learn what the matter involves and what its status is. Because it doesn&#039;t sound like a fixed-price matter like a closing or a lease review, an attorney might only be able to tell you what their hourly fee is. Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
