{'question': 'I have a question regarding my mothers house I will be inheriting.My mom passed away on 1/31/23, she had no will. At the time of her death she had a Mortgage with 219K left to pay off and 60k in credit card debt, and only 4k in savings. I would like to keep the house so I payed off her credit cards. By negotiating with the lenders I was able to reduce the 60k debt down to 30k. As administrator to her estate which is currently in probate, I have continued paying the mortgage and property taxes, all with my own money. I have the funds to pay off the mortgage completely, but I am wondering if it is possible to negotiate down the mortgage in a similar way to the credit card debt. Should/could I let the mortgage lapse like I did with my moms credit cards, then try to negotiate a lump some payoff with the lender?  \n \nBest Regards, \n \nRobert R', 'answer': 'Less likely than with the credit card debt.   \n \nBecause secured creditors are in an improved position over unsecured creditors, they have less incentive to settle debts; unsecured creditors often have little to no recourse from a debtor (who may, e.g., die or file bankruptcy).  Letting a mortgage note fall into default involves risk because the house will eventually go into foreclosure, risking a loss of the property (although NY has a relatively borrower-friendly judicial process the mortgage lender must go through).   \n \nFor this reason, lenders will not often accept a &quot;short payoff,&quot; unless there is good a reason to.  Some of this will depend on the value of the property.  If there is equity, it is even less likely because the lender is more-secured and can afford to wait out the time it takes to foreclose, receiving interest, late fees and attorneys fees along the way.'}
