{'question': 'Loan Agreement ReviewGood evening. I am lending capital to a real estate investor in my area and in turn I will be receiving 10% interest for a total of one year. I will receiving two documents, a promissory note and the loan agreement, and I would like a lawyer to review to make sure my interests are protected and that I will actually be receiving my money back plus the 10% interest after one year. Please let me know if you provide document review services and how much it would cost to review them (15 pages total for both docs). Thank you!', 'answer': 'Yes, I do know a great deal about this. I would have to discuss the matter and then review the documents. My website is easy to find. This space does not encourage contact information.'}
