{'question': 'Landlord attempted to enter my apartment forcibly.Landlord claimed to smell illegal drugs, he attempts to push me out the way to enter the appartment, I informed him that&#039;s illegal, if he think I&#039;m doing something illegal, call the cops, he did so, they found nothing because I don&#039;t any type of drugs. What made me mad is the fact he tried to enter the appartment without proper notice and tried to do so forcible. What can I do to ensure this doesn&#039;t happen again?', 'answer': 'You can file a police complaint.  You could also file a civil case against the landlord to prevent future attempts to push past you; however, most would not want to invest the funds necessary to litigate the matter and instead simply take precautions such as setting up video recording equiptment in the apartment to document any future violations.'}
