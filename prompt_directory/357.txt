{'question': 'I own a house. My s.o. moved in a few months ago but we are now breaking up. How long should I give for her to move out?I initiated the breakup. \n \nWe do not have a formal lease, but before she moved in we had verbally agreed that she would pay a fairly small amount monthly when she started living here (she did not ever start paying). \n \nThe house is in my name only, with a mortgage (don&#039;t know if this is relevant). \n \nI would like to understand both my legal obligations, and what would be fair/reasonable accommodations.', 'answer': 'If you need to go the route of commencing legal action to remove your S.O. from your home, the process can take longer than you may find tolerable.  Depending on whether the occupant is a tenant or a licensee, the required predicate notices can be as short as 10 days to as long as 90 days.  Only after service of predicate notices can the actual court case be commenced.  If you are in NYC, there is a substantial backlog of cases because of the Covid-19 crisis.  Since the courts are still working through pre-Covid cases, you can expect a substantial delay before new cases begin to be heard.'}
