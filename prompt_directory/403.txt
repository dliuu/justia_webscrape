{'question': 'NYC apt sublease in CoopMy tenant just sent me a message that he wants to end the sublease.The rider statesThat the sublease shall not end or be modified nor will sublessee obligations be ended or modified if for any cause not fully within sublessorâ€™s control \nBesides the board will not approve \nWhat do you suggest I should do? \nPlease let me know ASAP \nThank you \nDanielle', 'answer': 'As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, a flood of residential and commercial tenants are seeking to surrender possession and walk away from their lease obligations.  Although there is an Executive Order imposing a moratorium on evictions until August 20th, there is not legislation that relieves tenants of their rent obligations.  You can&#039;t prevent a tenant from moving but that doesn&#039;t mean you don&#039;t have a right to pursue a claim for damages for unpaid rent for the balance of the lease.  If you don&#039;t fully understand how to pursue you rights, you may consider retaining the services of a lawyer.'}
