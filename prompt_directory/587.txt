{'question': 'I live in NY State. I have a question regarding the legality of a letter/document.My wife and I own a home together in Orange County NY. Many years back, my wife under duress wrote a letter stating that upon the sale of our home, her mother would receive 1/3 of the profit from said sale. Is this letter legal. It was written as an email and only signed by my wife. The document was not signed by myself or by my mother-in-law, nor was it ever notarized.', 'answer': 'Greetings: \n \nThe rebuttal presumption would be that if her mother was to receive 1/3 of the profits from the sale of the home, her mother would have been added to the deed as a 1/3 owner; this did not occur. \n \nIn the alternative...(and courts typically do NOT incorporate ancillary agreements as to the sale of the property aside from the what the deed reflects as far as % of ownership interest).. a more formal, authenticated agreement....signed by all parties who were in title to the home...with two attesting witnesses...with all signatures notarized.... existed that specified &quot;she is entitled to 1/3 of the NET SALE proceeds of the home&quot;....specifying the reason why....then PERHAPS a legal argument can be made that your mother in law was entitled to 1/3 of the NET SALE Proceeds. \n \nThat said, based on your fact pattern, I would argue that there is no right, claim, or entitlement by your mother in law to ANY proceeds received from the sale of the home. \n \nBest, \nAN'}
