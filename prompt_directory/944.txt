{'question': 'I and my Sister in Law are Tenants in Common. House immediately passed to us outside of probate after my mother passed.I am also awaiting the Surrogates Court appointment as the Voluntary Administrator of her Small Estate (I am the named Executor in her will). Its been two months - courts seem backlogged - and can provide no estimates to this appointment - so I can&#039;t distribute property to beneficiaries yet. I have the duty to protect my mothers assets contained throughout the house. Sister in Law is not a Beneficiary under the will - and best viewed as a threat and danger to the personal property contained within. She and her lawyer have demanded a key to the house (or they will change the locks). If  a key is provided - I will no longer be able to protect her my mothers property. I have and continue to provide Sister in Law with supervised access to the premises whenever she needs it (house unoccupied). Can I continue to withhold this key - until court appointment and until property has been distributed?', 'answer': 'If she has joint title with you, she gets equal access.  Thus, you cannot prevent her entry.  If there are personal items to secure, remove them to another location.  Unless the items are titled in some way, no one can ever determine who owns what.'}
