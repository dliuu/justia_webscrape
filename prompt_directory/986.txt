{'question': 'Is there a way i can search online for a will that my grand parents might have left behind? This will is in puerto ricoGrand parents left a will but i have no copy of it. There is a house that belong to them and i would like to know if there is a will so the family don&#039;t fight over a property that is not worth much. If I can search and pay a small fee online to the courts in PR to find the will.', 'answer': 'You may want to repost this question in the Puerto Rico section. Click &quot;Show More States.&quot; Then at the bottom of the first column, you&#039;ll see &quot;U.S. Territories.&quot; Puerto Rico appears beneath that text. There&#039;s no guarantee that every question is picked up, but you&#039;d probably have better chances there. You could also add Probate and Estate Planning to the categories you post under. Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
