{'question': 'Is it legal for my landlord to make me get rid of one of my cars that I don&#039;t drive if it is registered and insured?I live in upstate NY.  I am allowed 2 spots in my driveway. The car is legal (insured and registered with plates on it), I&#039;m just not driving it right now. There is a dent on the side of the vehicle that may be &quot;unpleasant&quot; to look at. He gave me 30 days to remove it from the property or he said he will give me my 30 day notice to move out. Is this legal?', 'answer': 'If you do not have a lease and are not a rent-regulated tenant, the landlord has no obligation to keep you on as a tenant.  Provided the landlord&#039;s actions do not otherwise violate the law, such as being discriminatory, the landlord can ask you to move for any reason including not liking the car you are parking at the property.'}
