{'question': 'For NYS Real Estate Law 226(c) must the tenant move as requested or can he fight this notice from the landlord?This is a new landlord. My apartment building was recently bought with about one month from the previous owners. Must I vacate the premise? \nIs there any legal recourse? Must the landlord give a reason for the notice to vacate? \n \nThanks.', 'answer': 'The change of ownership won&#039;t affect the lease in effect. The new owner must respect and entertain the lease terms unless the lease says otherwise. S/he cannot kick you out. However, RPL ยง226-c concerns renewal (or no-renewal) of a residential lease. So if your lease is to expire soon and the new owner decides not to renew it, then you may be required to vacate the premises, provided that the new owner/landlord complied with the notice requirement under the law. S/he does not need to give you the reasons for the non-renewal determination.'}
