{'question': 'NYU students who rents a Village Apartment Impacted by CV19 Pandemic and Closure of NYU CampusI&#039;m an NYU undergraduate student who rents an apartment with 3 other classmates in the Village a couple of blocks from NYU Washington Square.  Due to CV19 pandemic, NYU has recently suspended classes for the rest of the semester and closed the campus and all dorms to students.  We rent our place close to campus from a private LL.  We&#039;ve now all returned to our homes outside of NYC and the apartment will remain vacant  (no need for it anymore).  We provided 1-month&#039;s rent as security deposit, paid a hefty broker&#039;s fee at lease signing and our parents acted as guarantors.  Do we have any ability to terminate the lease without risking additional liability going forward (the lease expires at the end of August) under NY State and Manhattan LL-T law.  Note that the lease itself doesn&#039;t have any type of liquidated damages clause (it&#039;s the standard RSA 2010 Lease form).', 'answer': 'No you cannot terminate.  You will be liable for the rent although right now there are no eviction actions allowed.  Try to sublet it.'}
