{'question': 'I own a property in Ballston Spa, NY in joint tenancy with an ex-partner. The property is in foreclosure(2year).The ex-partner has refused four decent offers in the last year. I&#039;ve just received the best offer yet, and he is refusing to respond. What legal defense is available if any? \n \nThank you for your response.', 'answer': 'I do not know what you mean by defenses.  To sell the property outside of foreclosure, you would need a partition action in Supreme Court.  If you let it go to foreclosure, and there is a surplus, you will get it.  If there is no surplus and this is a short sale issue, just let it go to foreclosure.'}
