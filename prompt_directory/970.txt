{'question': 'What is personal jurisdiction?I&#039;m Pro Se in a NY case and I requested a default judgment as defendants never responded or appeared in court. The defendants are also in NY and are now claiming personal jurisdiction and improper service. My understanding is that there is a time frame for them to argue personal jurisdiction.', 'answer': 'If the service was improper, there is no jurisdiction, so there is no time limit.  This is why it is helpful to have a lawyer.'}
