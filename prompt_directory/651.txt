{'question': 'Hi, I&#039;ve put my apartment on Airbnb and curious how I should split the profit with my boyfriend.I got the apartment(lease) by my self and lived there for a year by myself, I put down deposit, I paid a guarantor fee every month, decorated and bought all the furniture, I am doing all the daily maintenance of the Airbnb account and finding cleaner, photograper etc. My boyfriend moved in a year ago and have paid half the rent since. I don&#039;t have a TIN or SSN so I need him to do the Airbnb. How should we split the profit? \n \nI am paying a high monthly fee and 2k when moving in to have a guarantor which let me get the lease by myself without SSN.  \nThe reason to split it at all is cause I want to be fair to him, he has paid 50% rent for the last few months and we need his SSN/tin to post the Airbnb. Everything else is on and thanks to me.', 'answer': 'From a practical perspective (which is what it sounds like you are asking), an appropriate way to split income from the unit would be to first deduct all expenses and then to split the net income according to proportions of rent paid.   \n \nSo first you would deduct all of the fees and costs you have incurred; the maintenance of the AirBnb account, cleaner, photographer fees, etc. from the net, either until each is repaid in full, or as each comes due each month.   For things like your time in doing these things where it is not an out of pocket expense, you could come to an agreement as to how much each service is worth and use that as the deduction.  In terms of decorations and the like, if they are purchased expressly for the rental, they would also be deducted.  If not, and they are just your furniture that you would some day take with you, they could be depreciated if you wanted to get nit-picky, though it may not be worth the effort to determine this (as much of the depreciation occurs upon purchase).  After all of those deductions, and deductions for things like taxes that would be owed, you would split whatever is left according to the proportion of rent you pay (it sounds like that is 50/50). \n \nHope that helps.'}
