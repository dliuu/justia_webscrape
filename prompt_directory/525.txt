{'question': 'Is it illegal for my Dad&#039;s Girlfriend of 13 years to use his ATM card after he dies? What law makes this illegal in NY?My father was declared brain dead on Jan 9th, and passed away on Jan 24th. His girlfriend has made 2 withdrawals using ATM, one of which weeks after death. The DA said that it&#039;s not illegal if he gave her permission; but, how can he give permission if dead? They are not married. He died intestate, and I am the beneficiary. The police are dismissive stating that they will not do anything about it; but, this doesn&#039;t seem right. I don&#039;t know how to convince the DA that this is wrong and that it&#039;s illegal to take money from an account after the person dies unless you are lawfully entitled to the money.', 'answer': 'It is illegal.  Tell the bank he is dead and show a death certificate.  The account will be frozen until you collect it.  The police were wrong.'}
