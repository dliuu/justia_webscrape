{'question': 'landlord is selling the house I live in she is trying to let people come in our house to look around we are in BuffaloNew York and are in closing for COVID-19  \nWe have told her no but now her realtor is saying heâ€™s coming in anyway what can I do  \nAnd my landlord lives in Germany', 'answer': 'Unless your lease says otherwise or there is an emergency situation involved, the landlord is generally allowed to enter into the premise to prospective tenants or purchasers for purposes such as repairs, inspections, installation and showing the house/apt, provided that s/he gave you a &quot;reasonable advance notice (24 hr)&quot; for the upcoming entry. \n \nTheir visit is also required to be made at a &quot;reasonable&quot; time, which generally means after 9am and before 5pm, exclusive of weekends. So if the broker shows up at 5am with no prior notice with a wall street stranger who has to get to work early and want to see the place quickly before that, their entry may be lawfully rejected by you.  \n \nDepending on your relationship with the landlord and future intent of staying, etc, you may need to retain a lawyer.'}
