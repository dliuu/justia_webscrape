{'question': 'Can I put my rent into an escrow account for the landlord vs. using a guarantor ?Prior to the new rent laws it would be possible for me to pay a year upfront for rent. Now my only option is to use a guarantor. Would it possible to make an agreement with the landlord in which I put the money into an escrow account, and the landlord receives a fixed amount every month?', 'answer': 'Security deposits are essentially escrow deposits that can only be used under certain conditions and are limited to one month rent by Tenant Protection Act of 2019 so unlikely your proposal would be allowed.'}
