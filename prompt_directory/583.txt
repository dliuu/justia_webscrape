{'question': 'When selling a property in NYS does the seller owe the real estate agent a commission if the seller finds the buyer?The property in question is a small home located in rural Western New York State.', 'answer': 'This is really something that the real estate attorneys here would know the best, but you await an answer for two weeks. Until you&#039;re able to consult with an experienced real estate attorney for the most meaningful input, as a general matter, a seller&#039;s commission obligations to the agent or broker are likely to be governed by the terms of the listing agreement (exclusive, multiple, etc.). Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
