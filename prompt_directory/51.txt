{'question': 'my brother owns a home, i am his only sister and relative does it automatically pass to me upon his passingshould i get documentation before he passes and how would that impact me in terms of taxes', 'answer': 'The answers you got are right.  When you say he &quot;owns&quot; it, are you sure only his name is on the current deed?  If there is no will (which could leave it to anyone), and you are next of kin, you would inherit it.  There is no tax due unless the building is worth millions.  A bequest is not income taxable to you.'}
