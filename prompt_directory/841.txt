{'question': 'Applied for an apartment- lost my job less than 24 hours after and want my deposit back? NYC company is telling me noI am a recent college graduate who applied for a NYC co living apartment (shared w roomates). I submitted my bank info, authorized credit check, etc. and let them know I will be starting a post grad job this summer. \n \nLess than 24 hours later, I learned my job has been postponed indefinitley. Literally 15 hours after applying. I immediately (less than 24 hours after) ask them to refund my deposit as I no longer have a job to afford the apartment. Company is telling me no. \n \nDeposit is non refundable UNLESS application is denied. Do I have any angle to pursue legally? How can they approve a potential tenant with no rental history, no employment verification. I told them I don’t have a job anymore less than 24 hours later. I feel I should be denied and given a refund. \n \nDeposit: $1250 + $200 fees. \nI know it’s not their fault I lost my job, but I haven’t been approved yet and didn’t sign a lease. they need to consider the fact i now don’t have a job and deny my app &amp; refund me I feel', 'answer': 'How much money is at stake?  Your rights would be determined by whatever you signed when you paid.  Your job loss was not their fault, so it is possible you have no claim.'}
