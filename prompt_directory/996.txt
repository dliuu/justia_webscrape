{'question': 'Is a lease valid if tenant never rendered any funds?Lease was signed, and person moved in but no security deposit or rent has been paid at all', 'answer': 'This is something that the landlord-tenant attorneys here would have the most insight into, but your post remains open for a week. It was probably overlooked in the Real Estate Law category. There&#039;s no guarantee that all questions are ultimately picked up, but you could try reposting and adding Landlord-Tenant as a category. Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
