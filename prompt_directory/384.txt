{'question': 'Seller refusing to return the downpayment when we backed out before the sellers signed the contractI signed the contract and wired the deposit however sellers weren&#039;t signing the contract for several days and I decided to withdraw as this wasn&#039;t the first red flag. Now they are not responding at all to requests to refund the deposit. Since they didn&#039;t sign the contract, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s binding. What options do I have to get my money back? Is there any legal basis for them to not return the deposit promptly since the contract is not fully executed?', 'answer': 'You will need to commence a lawsuit and the sooner the better.  Strongly consider retaining counsel immediately.'}
