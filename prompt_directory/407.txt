{'question': 'My Mom recently passed and she owns a co-op in brooklyn that she is leaving to her 4 children.She has a will.The co-op board says we have to purchase her co-op then be approved first before we can sell it. and there are fees involved of course and we need to hire a lawyer. Is this legal?', 'answer': 'Part true and part not true.  The co-op can be left as provided in the will -- i.e, titled in all four of you.  The problem with this provision is that the co-op has the right to approve any transfer like a sale.  In short, the transferee needs to be approved like any regular buyer.  As some co-ops require that the occupants be the same as the owners, this will provision might be inconsistent with the co-op rules, which is a problem.  Also, if you are really giving a co-op to four people, each of you will have to provide an application, with the back-up.  You have to probate the will.'}
