{'question': 'My mother (90) owns her home in Huntington.  She would like to add her 2 daughters to the title.  What is the process?Can we do this by completing a form or do we need to get a lawyer? Can we file electronically?  I live in Maryland, but her house is in New York. Thank you.', 'answer': 'In order to add additional parties to title, a new deed must be executed.  Unfortunately, technology advances, such as esignatures have moved forward faster than our legal system has adapted.  Therefore, it is necessary to executed wet ink copies of the deed and accompanying transfer documents that are required.  In New York, this type of work is generally performed by attorneys for their clients.'}
