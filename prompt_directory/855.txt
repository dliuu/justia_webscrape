{'question': 'I purchased a home where $5,000 was kept in escrow for the owner to submit paper work to take care of the back deckWhich did not have a permit. I recently found out from my town that there are a couple other things in my house such as the front bay window that does not have permits for. I’m confused how the sellers lawyer and my lawyer did not know or how could sell a home without it not having all permits up to date. What can I do because I don’t feel I should be responsible for the cost now to get all permits up to date?', 'answer': 'Caveat Emptor! You should read your contract and see what is says and whether there are any representations and warranties as to any work performed. Attorneys generally are not going to review all renovations made to the house to confirm they were done legally. This is closer to a due diligence request for a contractor/architect/engineer. \n \nhttps://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/home-defects-new-york-what-can-buyer-do.html'}
