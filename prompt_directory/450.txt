{'question': 'If my lease doesn’t say “no pets” and I get a pet, can my landlord make me get rid of the pet or evict me?Amsterdam, NY asked on May 31, 2020 in Landlord - Tenant for New York', 'answer': 'If a pet damages the apartment or creates a nuisance, a landlord may seek to terminate a tenancy regardless of whether there is a &quot;no pet&quot; clause in a lease.  Even when a pet is well behaved, a landlord may decide not to renew a future lease in a non-rent regulated apartment if a landlord is unhappy with pets at the property.'}
