{'question': 'Hello, \nMy mother died in 1987 and owned two properties prior to death.  \nOne in Corning, NY and the other lake propertyI have not seen the Will but according to court documents, the property was named the Mourhess Family Trust and my brother was named as the Trustee. Before my mother died (she was in ill health) she sold both properties to my brother for $1 total, without me knowing about it. After she died, my brother refuses to speak to me and has broken off all contact. (Personally, I believe he played a role in her death). I have spoken to 3 attorneys since and they all told me that since he (Michael) was named as the Trustee, there is nothing I can do.  \nMy question is: is there anything that I can do? He sold the house but the lake property is very valuable.', 'answer': 'From 1987?  No there is nothing you can do.'}
