{'question': 'Real Estate Closing, NY  \n Is it legal for my lawyer to hire a lawyer to represent me at closing, without my permission?I was charged for the outside lawyer to represent me at the closing.', 'answer': 'It has been my experience that if you have a &quot;retainer&quot; agreement with the attorney, such agreement often includes language that says that the attorney might associate themselves with others to help you complete your matter.  Often real estate closings occur without retainer agreements because most times the attorney charges less than the amount where a written retainer is requred ($3,000 in NY).   So, it sounds like your attorney needed to have your closing covered to get it closed for you.   It is not &quot;illegal,&quot; but you probably should have been advised it was going to happen.'}
