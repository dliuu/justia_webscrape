{'question': 'I have a question regarding Bronx residents rights. My father passed in Oct. When him and I signed the lease 5 yearsagoManagement knew that I wont be on the lease but id be living there as I went with him to sign the lease. I&#039;ve done some research on squatters rights but iam unsure if it pertains to me. I&#039;d like to stay with the apartment but would like to advise management. This building is not Section 8 or NYCHA. These building are owned by individual Jewish folks who have been great to us so far. My question is, can I invoke &quot;squatters rights&quot; here in NYC (Bronx) ?  Or is this impossible?', 'answer': 'I am unclear if you have a lease at this point.  If you do not, then you have no right to stay as you remain a month to month tenant.  Why not just ask the landlord for a lease in your name to avoid trouble.'}
