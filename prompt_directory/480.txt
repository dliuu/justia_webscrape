{'question': 'Can I sue my building management for poor back of building care.May sound a bit mad but im not looking to cash out here. I just want our building management to be more competent in making sure tenants do not throw garbage out the their window. There is tampons, menstrual pads, shampoo bottles, dog  feces and other unsanitary things that probably shouldn&#039;t be all over the back of the building.  I&#039;ve already informed the superintendent in which he said he&#039;d give us a visit that eventually never happened. He is well aware.', 'answer': 'If you have already notified the building managment and not received a satisfactory response, it may be time to seek an inspection by the City of the conditions.  You can call 311 to request an inspection for possible violations.'}
