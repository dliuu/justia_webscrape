{'question': 'What do I do if a tenant stays after their lease has ended and I have a new tenant scheduled to move in?I have a tenant who had a month to month lease. The tenant was here less than 6 months and was given a 30 day notice of non-renewal. She is still here passed the lease end date. How do I get her to leave?', 'answer': 'If a tenant does not vacate at the end of his or her term, a landlord can commence a holdover proceeding to obtain a judgment of possession and schedule an eviction.  The process can take a good amount of time so the sooner you get started the better.'}
