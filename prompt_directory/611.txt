{'question': 'How do I add my mother to the deed of my home? I want to buyout my ex-husband&#039;s interest in the home &amp; need her on thereI&#039;m going through a divorce and am buying out my husband&#039;s interest in the home. My mom will be my co-borrower. The Bank states that I need to add my mother to the deed first before I am able to apply for a home equity loan. What documents do I need to in order to add her to the deed? I checked the Orange County NY Gov website and there are two forms: RP5217 (Real Property Transfer Report) and TP584 (Combined Real Estate Transfer Tax Return, Credit Line Mortgage Certificate, and Certification of Exemption from the Payment of Estimated Personal Income Tax). I&#039;m not sure which one to use. Any assistance would help. Thank you.', 'answer': 'Why does the bank need your mother to become an owner of your house so that she can co-sign your loan?  There can be tax (costs and ramifications) and liability issues when adding someone to the title of your home, and this should not be done lightly - and certainly not at the request of someone at the bank who owes no duty to you.  You need to retain an attorney to represent you in the refinance - maybe the attorney representing you in the divorce - to discuss and make sure it makes sense to add your mother to your deed.  And to ensure it&#039;s done properly, assume that&#039;s what you decide.'}
