{'question': 'What can I do if my Mother, the landlord of a residence, used self help eviction tactics against me ? In NYS.My Mother abandoned the house and relocated. Stopped paying the mortgage as well. Bought herself a new condo. My family and I are living in the home currently. There&#039;s a forebearance on the house, which I haven&#039;t found out since October 2020. There&#039;s utilities that aren&#039;t working in the home. Need help finding a new place to live. Looking to countersue for pain and suffering, emotional distress. I had been seen by a therapist in July 2020.', 'answer': 'The landlord&#039;s failure to pay the mortgage or taxes on a property, does not automatically constitute an eviction and tenants are generally required to continue to pay the rent to the owner/landlord during a foreclosure case unless a receiver is appointed.'}
