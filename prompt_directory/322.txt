{'question': 'Landlord told me to vacate the property due to &quot;roommate conflict&quot;. How do I ensure receiving my security back?My landlord communicated thru a 3rd party (my mother) 10.13/14 to vacate my current rental due to roommate conflict 2 months into a 12 month rental. There is no current conflict, but I have found alternative housing. Everything thus far has been verbal and thru my mother. How do I ensure my security back? You attention and expertise is greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Justin', 'answer': 'Justin, this is a little more detailed than can be written in this forum with justice.
