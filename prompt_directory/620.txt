{'question': 'I believe I am a heir to my mothers ties to a property her second husband had when he passed away.My mother is also deceased. The property is up for foreclosure and an administrator was assigned I think. I&#039;ve been getting pestered by investors to sell my share and the deceased family to sign forms last three years', 'answer': 'Iâ€™m not totally sure what your question is.   \n \nFirst I would suggest you obtain a better grasp on your interest(s) and who the relevant parties are (e.g. whether there is an administrator and whether you were in fact an heir to property).   \n \nNext I would be very cautious about anyone pestering to buy a property in foreclosure in which you have an interest; New York has a law called the home equity theft protection act to prevent against certain types of foreclosure-related sales.   \n \nFeel free to clarify what your question actually is, but I see your needing to consult with an attorney in your near future.'}
