{'question': 'Can I be sued personally for a property I purchased under an llc?I purchased a property under an llc. Unbeknownst to me the deed was fraudulent. I signed the deed back to the real owner. I did some repairs until I found out the deed was fraudulent. The real owner is now suing my llc and me personally for treble damages done to the property. Can they go after me personally? BTW the house was completely destroyed when we started cleaning and I have videos of the inside before I started repairs. FBI was on the case and saw I had nothing to do with it.', 'answer': 'Anyone who pays the $210 filing fee can sue anyone for anything.  Your issue is whether you can win.  That will turn on the documents you have, and the facts of what you did, none of which are clear from your post.'}
