{'question': 'Can the executor of my aunt&#039;s estate come after me for the joint account my aunt put me on years before she passed away?my brother, one of the beneficiaries of the will, left me a threatening message saying I&#039;m suppose to pay all the expenses from that and that I robbed him!', 'answer': 'Simply having a joint account does not mean that both parties to the account are equal owners of the asset.  For example, many older people will add an adult child to a bank account for convenience in having assistance with banking matters instead of to make a gift.'}
