{'question': 'I loaned 20,000 to a family member for a housing flip. They still haven’t paid back. Can I charge interest?The contract never gave a direct date of when the project was to be done. But it’s been finished for over a year now and I still haven’t received the money. Can I charge interest even if it wasn’t specified on the contract that I would do so?', 'answer': 'The first thing courts tend to look at in any contractual relationship is the express agreement between the parties. If there are ambiguities or inconsistencies, a court can consider outside evidence. A court can also consider legal theories that raise issues of fairness, reliance, and other concepts. But some of those are more textbook in nature than day-to-day reality; by and large, express terms of the underlying written agreement are what courts generally give the most weight to. \n \nTim Akpinar'}
