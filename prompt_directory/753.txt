{'question': 'How can my cousins in Maine gift me a piece of family land that is still in my great-great grandmother&#039;s name?My cousin&#039;s father paid taxes on the land all of his adult life. \nWhen he died, the town sent the bills to my cousins. They have been paying the taxes on the land for about 40 years. \nThey would like to gift the land to me, but title search shows the land still in my great-great grandmother&#039;s name. The town has been billing the land as part of my cousins&#039; father.', 'answer': 'You need to talk to a Maine Real Estate Attorney.  New York law and Maine law is likely different, but if your great, great grandmother is deceased, the land likely transferred by operation of law (intestate succession or by will) even if the deed was never changed.'}
