{'question': 'Wondering if I can take legal action against  a seller/ contractor/ flipper after I the buyer waived the home inspectionI had made an offer on the house and was told by My realtor that it was between me and one other if I waived the home inspection I would  get the house, I asked about  the roof and the realtor said that the seller said it looked good when they looked at it so now 8 months later I need a complete tear off for 12000 dollar . I looks as though they half patch the roof,they said everything was new though out the house, turned out what that meant was new to that house, just would like too know if there is anything I can do. Thanks', 'answer': 'Nothing.  NY sales are &quot;as is&quot; unless you modified the contract both to account for conditions and for the representation to survive closing.  Never waive an inspection.'}
