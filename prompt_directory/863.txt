{'question': 'Is there a specific law stating fire departments are responsible for visitors on department property.Doing research for a class project', 'answer': 'It does not seem like something that would expressly be spelled out in any statute or code. But you should still research and check municipal codes and ordinances (including those written by FDNY) to be certain. If after diligently checking, you find no such provisions, you could consider including a discussion on how such responsibility could be implied. That should get you started in the right direction. Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
