{'question': 'Did Seller void a contract by not closing in time?My mother entered a contract to purchase a home. In the document she signed, it states very plainly that closing must be on or before September 22, 2023. My mother was told possession would occur at closing.  \nThe owner of the property was not ready to close on or before September 22nd, instead she decided to take a last minute vacation and we were told by our realtor the seller would require more time. My mother didn&#039;t approve of this. The seller did not close on or before 9/22 and my mother withdrew her offer four days later. On the next day after my mother withdrew the offer, the seller&#039;s lawyer states seller is &quot;ready willing and able to close,&quot; despite my mother withdrawing her offer already. The seller&#039;s lawyer filed Time of the essence despite the offer being removed and now claim they don&#039;t have to give back the &quot;Good faith&quot; deposit of $5K. My mother argues seller voided the contract when she didn&#039;t close in time. Who is in the right? My mother feels taken advantage of.', 'answer': 'Your mother should have had an attorney since the contract likely required that closing be on or about September 22, 2023, and if the Seller could not do so, the Purchaser, your mother, had to make a TOE demand to force a closing. But as matters developed, your mother likely breached the contract. She may forfeit the deposit because a right to cancel usually does not exist, and refusing to close as demanded by the Seller is often considered a downpayment forfeiting a breach of the contract.'}
