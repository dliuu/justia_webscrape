{'question': 'landlord is selling the house I live in she is trying to let people come in our house to look around we are in BuffaloNew York and are in closing for COVID-19  \nWe have told her no but now her realtor is saying heâ€™s coming in anyway what can I do  \nAnd my landlord lives in Germany', 'answer': 'It is not uncommon for a landlord to seek to have real estate brokers show property that is already occupied.  Most written leases have provisions that deal with the landlord&#039;s rights to show an apartment or house; therefore, you should review yours.  New York has guidelines for showing property depending on the level of Covid infections in an area and you can certainly request additional precautions.  If the property is sold, the new owner may keep you on as tenants or would have to commence a holdover case to compel you to move if they wanted you to vacate.'}
