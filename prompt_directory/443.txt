{'question': 'I need help with an irrevocable trust of my grandmother regarding her house. She has died how do I obtain my portion?The trust divided her house into 4 ways.  1 of the beneficiaries has died leaving 3 of us left. 1 of the 3 is currently living in the home refuses to leave or settle the house affairs. I do not know how to obtain my piece of the house. I do not have money to hire a lawyer to settle this. The house is located in NY state. My grandmother died 4 years ago the trust was put in place in 2008. \n \n(Edited your ADD)  \nI went to the District Court office and obtained a copy of the Deed which includes NYS Form 8002 regarding the irrevocable trust stating how the house is to be divided. I’m in the process of obtaining death certificates. I just wasn’t sure if I necessarily needed an attorney to settle this matter or if there was a form I could file on my own being my name is on the Deed of the property.', 'answer': 'I know you say you have no money for a lawyer, but you are going to have to sue to get your share.  The trust and divided ownership was a complex estate plan, and makes things more difficult for you.  It is not a simple case.'}
