{'question': 'Can I change the locks on my door to prevent three licensees from entering.A Stipulation Agreement was issued in December ordering my sister, her husband and 22 year old disabled child to vacate on or befire May 31, 2020. In March that family went to Baltimore to reside with their oldest daughter during this pandemic. I am 71 years old and their return may be a threat to my life. I need a legal recourse in light of this danger.', 'answer': 'It sounds like you may have resolved an eviction case through a stipulation of settlement.  Generally, a stipulation of settlement will state that upon non-compliance you may obtain a judgment and warrant of eviction.  A warrant of eviction will permit the Sheriff to physically remove the tenants and their belongings.   \n \nIt sounds like they followed the stipulation and vacated before May 31, 2020.  I&#039;m not sure what your concern is.  Do you think they are going to come back after May 31?'}
