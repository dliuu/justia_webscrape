{'question': 'Ex-partner and myself is on mortgage; how do I go about removing my name?We separated two years ago, and part of our agreement was for me to move out, and she&#039;ll retain the home, as long as she can maintain the monthly payments. At the time of agreement, I didn&#039;t have the resources to do things the RIGHT way and wanted the path of least resistance to just take my loss and start over, alone. The plan was for her to find &quot;someone&quot; who she can refinance with eventually, that way I&#039;m no longer tied to the situation.  \n \nThat said: I&#039;m in a predicament now where the bank collection dept. has contacted me about a 60 delinquent account [last payment was 2/3/2020]. I&#039;ve reached out to my ex twice via email, to no avail. \n \nI need to know the next best course of action, legally.', 'answer': 'If your ex-partner is financially capable of a refinance, this would be the best way to get your name off the mortgage. Otherwise, the only other way to accomplish this would be for your ex-partner to obtain a mortgage assumption by way of a loan modification - this is probably something you&#039;d have to do together. \n \nIf any of this sounds like something you will be uncomfortable collectively doing on your own, it may be in your best interest to consult with an attorney in regard to this matter. \n \nGood luck with your case!'}
