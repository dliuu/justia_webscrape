{'question': 'As a landlord how much notice do I have to provide tenants to leave property if Iâ€™m in the process of selling?New York, NY asked on September 6, 2023 in Landlord - Tenant for New York', 'answer': 'Generally, landlord&#039;s are not required to provide any advance notice to tenants that a property is being sold.  Instead the purchaser simply steps into the shoes of the seller in relationship to the tenants after the closing.  If the owner is seeking to have non-rent regulated tenants move in contemplation of an anticipated sale, the amount of notice depends on the length of the tenancy ranging from 30 to 90 days and the owner may have to commence a holdover proceeding in Housing Court against tenants that fail to honor the notice.  Therefore, it can take significantly longer to actually compel tenants to vacate regardless of a pending sale.'}
