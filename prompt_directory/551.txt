{'question': 'My mother has land in Puerto Rico which we want to give to the government. How do we do it.Land is to be sold to pay taxes.', 'answer': 'I&#039;m sorry your question remains open for three weeks. You could try reposting this under the Real Estate category for Puerto Rico. Look for the linked text, &quot;Show More States.&quot; When you click that, you&#039;ll see Puerto Rico toward the lower portion of the page under &quot;US Territories.&quot; There&#039;s no guarantee every question is picked up here, but there are attorneys in Puerto Rico who are active on this Q &amp; A board and they would have better chances of noticing your question there. Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
