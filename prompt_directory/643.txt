{'question': 'Mortgage - Acknowledgement of Contribution - is he fully responsible now?A few years ago my boyfriend’s parents were struggling financially and ended up modifying their mortgage loan (details unknown). \nIn this process, they asked my boyfriend to sign an acknowledgement of contribution stating that he lives there, is their son, and has been “contributing ____$ funds to assist the borrowers in making their mortgage payment for a period of ___2___ months.”  It also says “I will continue to assist the borrowers in making their monthly payments for the foreseeable future”. He gave his DOB, SSN, and signed. Where he signed, the clause reads “I do not claim any interest in the above-referenced property nor am I legally obligated under the original Note and subsequent Loan Modification agreement with the above-referenced borrower.”  \n \nThe full mortgage has appeared on his credit report ever since as if he is fully liable and paying this mortgage, including their late payments. Is this a mistake? Or is he responsible? What exactly took place here?', 'answer': 'He very well may be responsible because he signed a written promise to pay.  This situation resulted from sloppy legal work and conflicting written agreements.  \n \nJack'}
