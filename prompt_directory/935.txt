{'question': 'How do i get my name added to a deed.  In Orange County NYI am the administrator of my father&#039;s estate.  My stepmother who predeceased him took out a mortgage in her name only.  I cannot get any information on the loan until i get my name added to the deed.  What is the quickest way for me to get this done.  This information is needed urgently.', 'answer': 'You may be better off reposting under the &quot;Real Estate&quot; category. I&#039;m sorry your question remains open for two weeks, given the urgency of the matter. It was probably overlooked under the &quot;Government Contracts&quot; heading. Some questions do go unanswered on this forum, but you would have better chances of a response from someone with insight into deeds by reposting under the &quot;Real Estate&quot; heading. Since you mention an estate, you might also consider adding the categories of &quot;Probate&quot; and &quot;Estate Planning&quot; to cover all bases. Good luck'}
