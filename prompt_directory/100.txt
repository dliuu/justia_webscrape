{'question': 'Hello, I live with my elderly, disabled mother in a rent stabilized apt.Hello, I live with my mother in a rent stabilized apt. Unfortunately i was let go from my job during covid and got backed up on my rent. I had to quit my new job also because i was accepted into nursing school. My mother is disabled and on dialysis. My name is on the lease. My question is, can we be evicted for non payment of rent even though my mom is disabled and elderly? I recently submitted an ERAP application to help and buy me more time to come up with the 3 months rent owed. \n \nAlso, in dec 2021 packages were stolen from me in the mailroom where there are cameras. I asked the super to see videos of days in question and I was told the cameras were not working. I called landlord and he said cameras are working. He only sent me clips of videos which doesnt show me anything and i was still not compensated. These cameras dont work for most of the time.', 'answer': 'There are many available services to assist tenants with avoiding eviction based upon age or disability status.  However, neither age nor disability status bar evictions for nonpayment of rent'}
