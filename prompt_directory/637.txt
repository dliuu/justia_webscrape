{'question': 'Does my boyfriend have a claim to a house deeded to me?I purchase a house fresh out of college.  It is deeded to me; my boyfriend co signed on the loan.  We broke up and I asked him to move out.  For 2 + year, he contributed $200.00 to monthly  expenses, while I paid the taxes, furniture etc.  He now wants 50,000 from me.  AM I wrong given the house is deeded to me? I reside in NY  I offered him 2,000 back for what he paid into the expenses for the 2+ years.  I have since refinance the mortgage taking his name of the obligations and can find no cause for him to think he is entitled to anything affiliated with the house', 'answer': 'Based on your post he would not have an interest in the house, and not have a claim for $50,000.  He would need to show the money he paid was a loan to you, and not a gift, or rent.  The burden is on him.'}
