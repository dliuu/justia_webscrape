{'question': 'My boyfriend who is not on the lease but comes over, sleeps over I gave him keys and he got into an argument with anothanother tenant because she was startled and didn&#039;t know who he was, she is claiming now she feels unsafe to open her door, landlord doesn&#039;t know i have a boyfriend, can I get in trouble', 'answer': 'It&#039;s unfortunate that your neighbor had an argument with your boyfriend but hopefully you can smooth that over.  It sounds as if you are nervous about the landlord finding out you have a boyfriend stay over but that is not something you would usually need to be concerned about as the landlord cannot restrict your guests to prevent you from having a boyfriend stay over.  In fact, in NYC you are allowed to have a roommate whether or not the landlord consents so having a boyfriend stay over is not a legal concern.'}
