{'question': 'Can i start a legal case against my building if they refuse to exterminate and caulk floor due to thick gaps?I have tiny beetles infestation in my toddler and I apartment which as of sep 9th has been notified to the building manager. The manager states he cant caulk the floor due to “possible expansion and elevation of the foundation” and the exterminator stated “they will eventually go away” i have all my son and i belongings in bags and elevated above ground since the beetles due climb the walls and are on the ground. They are also in the tub coming out the drain. I have audio recordings of the exterminator refusing treatment and the BM stating he “can’t” properly caulk the floor. I am sleeping in my son toddler bed with him , causing excruciating leg pain , and much more health concerns and time loss in important things. I am unsure what else to do since no one in my building will act on this and everyone is refusing to provide me the landlord information “since there isnt one”. Im unsure if at this point its discrimination due to this being an affordable housing unit in a luxury building.', 'answer': 'You can commence an HP proceeding in Housing Court.  The Court will schedule an inspection and if violations are issued the landlord will be order to make necessary repairs and/or exterminate.'}
