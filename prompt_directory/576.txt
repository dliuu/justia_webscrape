{'question': 'Can I own a house in Puerto Rico but continue living in New York? or do I have to live in Puerto Rico part of the time?New York, NY asked on January 3, 2021 in Estate Planning and Real Estate Law for New York', 'answer': 'Your post remains open for four weeks. Not every question is ultimately answered on this board, but you could try reposting under Puerto Rico to seek legal insights from attorneys who practice in Puerto Rico, where the house is situated. If you still receive no response, you could reach out to attorneys (the Find-a-Lawyer tab above). Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
