{'question': 'Rent is being increased from 1950 to 3500 with no written notice. What can I do? Lived in the home for 12yrs on LI.The current lease that I have signed by the owners of the home is dated 2012. One of the owners has passed away and the second owner is bed-bound and dying. The wife has hired a broker and the broker is making all the decisions on the home. When speaking with the broker she states that all the other properties are rented for 3K but they have more living space than my home. The broker refuses to give us anything in writing. I pay rent plus all utilities. What are my options?', 'answer': 'Unless you have a current lease or live in rent regulated housing, there is no restriction on the amount that a landlord may charge for rent.  However, in 2019 HSTPA was enacted state-wide and landlord&#039;s are required to give written 30-90 day notice of rent increases of 5% or more.'}
