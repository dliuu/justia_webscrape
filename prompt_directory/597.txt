{'question': 'A friend  said that  you don&#039;t own the land your house is on in NYC, even if its paid for, is this true?It&#039;s paid for and I pay the taxes.. Please advise, in detail. Thank you.', 'answer': 'In most cases in New York City, if you own a house, you also own the land it&#039;s on, known as &quot;fee simple&quot; ownership. However, there are exceptions, like land leases in some co-op buildings, where you might not own the land. If you&#039;re paying property taxes and have a standard ownership deed, it&#039;s likely you own both the land and the house.'}
