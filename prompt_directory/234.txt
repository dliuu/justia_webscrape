{'question': 'If information isn’t printed legibly in a lease is it still valid?My husband signed a one year lease but ended up getting a job in another part of the state so he needs to terminate his lease early. They are saying he needs to pay one month rent as an early termination fee. In the lease where that information is to be printed the space is empty and is actually printed underneath the line above it so you can’t see it. Does he still have to pay the early termination fee if it’s not legible in the lease?', 'answer': 'Unless the lease contains specific provisions that allow for early termination, there is not right for the tenant to terminate a lease early and the landlord can seek to hold the tenant responsible for the full term of the lease.  It is not uncommon for landlord&#039;s to request a payment to agree to terminate a lease early.'}
