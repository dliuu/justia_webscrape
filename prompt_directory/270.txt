{'question': 'I have a situation with a tenant that is subletting and they do not want to return my security depositWe did not have any written agreement about security deposit, instead everything was verbal', 'answer': 'It isn&#039;t unusual for residential rental agreements of various types to be verbal instead of written; therefore, no need to be overly alarmed that any agreement is not in writing.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to understand from your post who &quot;they&quot; may be but I assume you are referring to the landlord.  If you rented a residential apartment from the landlord and later subleased the space, the landlord would not generally be required to return your security deposit until the property was delivered back to the landlord free of all occupants, including any subtenant you may have placed in the property.'}
