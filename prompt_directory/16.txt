{'question': 'I am holding a mortgage for an 80 yr.old. What is the name of the document we should have in place in case he passes?Syracuse, NY asked on January 20, 2023 in Real Estate Law for New York', 'answer': 'If by &quot;holding a mortgage&quot; you mean you are the lender on the note secured by a mortgage against property owned by the 80 year old borrower, provided your mortgage is propertly recorded there should be no additional documents required to secure your loan.  Regardless of age, the unfortunate reality is that any borrower can pass at any time so the note and mortgage are designed to protect a lender&#039;s interest regardless of the longevity of the borrower.'}
