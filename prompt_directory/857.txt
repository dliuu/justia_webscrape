{'question': 'We bought a mobile home with land in Oswego N.Y on October 6th 2020The seller paid the taxes on the property on October 4th before we purchased. We’ve been trying to transfer the deed but the seller won’t return our calls or texts but sent us a letter wanting us to pay him for the taxes he paid and then he will send us the deed. We feel he is responsible for paying the taxes before we purchased but need our deed. What can we do?', 'answer': 'What does the contract say? Generally the contract will determine who is liable for the property taxes. Often, it is the case that the seller prepaid for part of the quarter and will receive a credit at closing for the time the seller is not in possession.'}
