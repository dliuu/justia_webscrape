{'question': 'I paid first month rent and security deposit before i moved in.  Can they use my security deposit for 2nd month?I am having a problem with my bank account due to fraud, I am wondering if management can use the security deposit I gave before I moved in for this month that I owe rent on.', 'answer': 'Security deposits are designed to provide the landlord with protection against the cost of damages or unpaid rent at the end of a tenancy.  Therefore, landlords are not obligated to apply the security deposit towards rent while a tenant is still in occupancy.'}
