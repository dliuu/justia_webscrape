{'question': 'I signed a lease, but the landlord has not countersigned. I have also not taken possession, can I back out of the lease?I am trying to get out of this lease, it is a non-regulated property. The landlord is insisting that I have to relet the apartment and I am still liable.', 'answer': 'Dear Syracuse Tenant: \n \nIt does not sound to me that you have a lease without the keys in hand and a delivered countersigned lease received from the landlord. Since you did not give the &#039;landlord&#039; any money that must be returned why are you concerned about what this failed landlord said to you?'}
