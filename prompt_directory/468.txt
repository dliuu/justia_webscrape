{'question': 'how do I go about starting adverse possession /obtain deed on attached  lot?Bought a home 10 years ago.  Title company at our closing found that attached lot was never transferred to previous owner some 30 years prior.   The lot was mistakenly put in previous owner.s name.   Previous owner used as a yard , cared for it, and paid taxes on it for 30 plus years (tacking).  I continued that practice.  Woman named on title died 70 years ago with no known heirs. \nHow can I finally get this lot in our name and receive a deed for it?', 'answer': 'An adverse possession case proceeds in a manner governed by the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law.  Among other things, you may be required to find the next of kin of the property.  There are issues with your case.  For adverse possession, you need to believe you own the property.  It would appear you were clear you did not own it, but paid taxes to prevent a tax foreclosure.  Thus, the case must be handled carefully.'}
