{'question': 'if my co-op went into foreclosure 2002  2004 i have not received any notice of what bank took over still living there ??what are my options  now   the co-op is in westchester new york', 'answer': 'Do you mean your apartment was foreclosed, or the whole co-op was foreclosed?  If the former, I assume you got nothing and there is no surplus.  If there is, you can claim it.  The sale price will be recorded in the Westchester county clerk.  If the latter, it is more complicated.'}
