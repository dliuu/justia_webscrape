{'question': 'Can I sell my half of a house co-owned with my ex-wire?  We are both on the mortgage.Ex-wife makes payments out of alimony as per divorce agreement.  She needs to buy me out or sell the house in about3 years.  When the house is sold we split the profits.  Can I sell my half to someone else?  We are both on the mortgage.', 'answer': 'You can sell it if there is no prohibition in you divorce decree or the stipulation you entered into (if there is one).  The divorce dissolved the ownership by husband and wife.  Of course anyone that buys your half would have to wait the 3 years for the house to be sold.'}
