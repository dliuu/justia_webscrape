{'question': 'Does an item in an Offering plan remain in effect forever?  Can it be changed or eliminated?  If so, how is this done?Our offering plan for a condominium contains a line item in the budget for basic cable service.  This was in 1988.  How would the association revise or eliminate this item?

Some units have a different cable service but are still charged for service that they do not get.', 'answer': 'Greetings: \n \nAny by-law to a Condominium Offering Plan can be amended by the Board of Managers unanimously voting to pass an AMENDMENT to any particular provision in the existing by-laws. \n \nSpeak with any Board Member in this regard to proceed in having this accomplished.'}
