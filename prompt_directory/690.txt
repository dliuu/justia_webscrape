Y?A person I knew asked for a $400k investment with the promise of a return. Never materialized. Waited substantial amount of time before recording a lien for the $400k on his home in 2008. He would not answer the entire time so I waited. And now I was served papers last night and I am named as a defendant along with the person,his wife, also Bank of America is a defendant against the Plaintiff who is Wells Fargo. Is it only because I have a recorded lien? I have no other dealings with them. Am I going to now get my money back with this action?', 'answer': 'I agree with my colleagues.  Retain counsel. \n \nJack'}
