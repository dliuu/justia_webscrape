{'question': 'I have been helping a friend out for the last 18mths with a place to stay. Can I put them out without legal problemsBronx, NY asked on February 10, 2021 in Landlord - Tenant for New York', 'answer': 'Unfortunately, no good deed goes unpunished.  In NYC once someone has resided in a home for 30 days or more, a court order of eviction is required before a tenant can be legally evicted.  If your friend will not voluntarily leave, you would need to start a holdover proceeding in Housing Court to obtain a legal eviction.  It is important that the predicate notice and court papers be completedly properly or your case will be subject to dismissal, so always better to have an attorney represent you.'}
