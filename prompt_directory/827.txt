{'question': 'How long should it take for my first month’s rent from my rental application be refunded to me?I paid an application fee and first month’s rent for an apartment I was looking to rent. The real estate agent told me if I did not get the apartment, then the first month’s rent is refundable, but the application fee is not. I could not get the apartment due to COVID, so it went to another renter.  \nBut it has now been almost three weeks, and I have not received my refund.  \nAfter one week of not receiving the refund, I asked my real estate agent to process it, and he said the money would go straight back to my credit card that I used to pay, and he would update me when it was done. Another week went by, and I still hadn’t been refunded, so I reached out to him again, and he said he would look into it and let me know, but I never heard back. I have tried calling the agency’s office directly, but no one has answered, but I assume that is because the office is closed, due to COVID. \n \nIf anyone has any suggestions or advice, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!', 'answer': 'Call you credit card company and explain the situation.  They should be able to process a charge-back. \n \nYou can also file a complaint with the New York State Department of State, Division of Licensing.  This is a serious violation.'}
