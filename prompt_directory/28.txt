{'question': 'How soon can I take my landlord to small claims court to get my security deposit back . Itâ€™s been over 30 days .Also do they have to give back double for not having it back on time?', 'answer': 'You may also considering serving the landlord or his attorney with a properly drafted pre suit demand letter. If effective, this can save you a lot of time and the cost of initiating a court action. As my colleague said, if 14 days have passed since move out and you have not been provided an itemized account of the alleged damage to the apartment, you may do this immediately.'}
