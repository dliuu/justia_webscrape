{'question': 'Question about tenants livingI live in the first floor and the people upstairs don’t pay rent they live for free and the person who has leased the apartment is away. These people who now live upstairs have been causing a lot of noise and ruckus’s throughout the whole day and night. What can I do legally to stop this. I’ve tried 311 and I tried to call the cops but nothing helps. These people don’t live here and don’t pay rent is there any legal action I can take', 'answer': 'If you are a tenant, you may alert your landlord to the problem you are experiencing and ask for assistance.  Unfortunately, as a result of the Covid-19 crisis, the landlord cannot commence legal action against these neighbors until the courts reopen for regular business.'}
