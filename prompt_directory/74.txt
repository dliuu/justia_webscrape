{'question': 'Can I evict a squatter not on the lease?I have a tenant who has been paying the rent. They took in a roommate who is not on the lease and had refused to pay rent as they agreed upon. Can I evict the squatter and get my locks changed?', 'answer': 'Tenants are permitted to have roommates but any issue between the tenant and his/her roommate is not a basis for you to evict the roommate. Depending on the circumstances, you could start a case against your tenant as well as the roommate.  However, as long as you are being paid the agreed rent by your tenant it isn&#039;t your problem to fix if the roommate doesn&#039;t pay your tenant.'}
