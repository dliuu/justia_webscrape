{'question': 'My fiance and my dtr bought a house and the title is only on her name, can his older kids claim this house in future?Loan as well as the title. After closing the title will be ONLY ON MY DAUGHTERS NAME \nWill my fiance kids (all married) claim the house when hes not around anymore?', 'answer': 'You could repost and add Real Estate, Probate, and Estate Planning as categories - those areas of law are closer to the issues you raise than the Family Law category is. Not every question is picked up, but you could have better chances there. Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
