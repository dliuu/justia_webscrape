{'question': 'Can a landlord contract out (eg lease says 60 days) of the NYC law to return a security deposit in 14 days?New York, NY asked on September 19, 2023 in Landlord - Tenant for New York', 'answer': 'In New York, state law mandates that a landlord must return a security deposit within 14 days after the tenant has vacated the property. Even if a lease agreement states a different duration, such as 60 days, provisions that attempt to waive or diminish a tenant&#039;s rights under the law are generally unenforceable. Thus, in NYC, a landlord cannot contract out of the 14-day requirement to return a security deposit.'}
