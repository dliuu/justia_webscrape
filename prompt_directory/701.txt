{'question': 'Can the family force access to a NYC decedent&#039;s home, in reverse mortgage status, where there are residents and no will?As caretaker for over twenty years living in in a NYC home in reverse mortgage, my client died recently.  Because the three siblings stopped access to detailed information from the doctor&#039;s during my former client&#039;s dying days, I refuse to cooperate with them.  Can they forcefully access the decedent&#039;s house where I currently reside  in order to search for paperwork belonging to my former client? If so, what must they present to me?', 'answer': 'Have a free telephone consultation with counsel.  \n \nJack'}
