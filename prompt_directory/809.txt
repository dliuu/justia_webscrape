{'question': 'Can I break a comm. office sublease in NYC if I discovered the Cert. of Occupancy is for storage only, not office use?It’s a hosting agreement, avoids the word ‘lease’, so perhaps not technically a sublease.  \nI never took occupancy. \nLandlord was ok with us delaying start date due to Covid19, but now wants to begin term. \nIn researching NYC phase 2 Covid19 reopening guidance, I discovered the building has only an S1 Storage C of O, no office use allowed.', 'answer': 'It depends on the terms of your lease.  If you took &quot;as is&quot; and there is no representation that it is for office use, you might have problems.  If there is such a representation, you have a defense if the landlord comes after you for the money.'}
