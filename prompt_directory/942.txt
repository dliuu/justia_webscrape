{'question': 'I am the remainderman of a life estate. Should I have received any documentation (i.e. deed) after probate is done?Grandfather passed away a few months ago and gave a life estate to my aunt who lives in the home. She is also the executor of his will. I am a remainderman. Now that probate is complete, should I have received anything that says I own an interest in the home? Or it is simply passed on to me upon my aunt&#039;s death?', 'answer': 'There should be a recorded deed with you as remainderman,  and aunt with life estate.  Ask the lawyer for a copy, or you need to go to the County Clerk (if Suffolk Co., which is where you posted from).'}
