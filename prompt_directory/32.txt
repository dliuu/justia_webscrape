{'question': 'Should I signed a commercial lease that my landlord sent me when I&#039;m a residential tenant?I lose my job in August and since I didn&#039;t have the money to paid the rent I apply for ERAP. I informed my landlady and she is ok with this but they still have not approved my application. Today I received a message from my landlady to please sign a lease she sent me via email. When I look at it the lease was for a hair salon not a residential property and dated the lease was signed by was at the beginning of this year and ending in December. I call EARP to find out if this was necessary they told me that my application was being reviewed and to call back in one to two weeks. What should I do about this lease that is not only a commercial lease but it was signed 1/1/2022( she also had a witness sign)and that is a lie?', 'answer': 'You should not sign.  Sounds like it was an error.  There is literally a form for both the residential lease and the commercial store lease.  I think maybe she just sent the wrong one.'}
