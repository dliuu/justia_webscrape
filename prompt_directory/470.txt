{'question': 'New York State - when exactly are security deposits required to be placed in an interest bearing account?I currently own one 4-unit building  and plan to purchase additional properties in the near future, all in NY. From what I gather in the responses, the 6-unit law pertains to an individual building, not the total number of units a landlord owns, correct?  \nAlso, I read that if the deposit amount is $750 or greater it might be required to be placed in an interest-bearing account. Is that accurate?', 'answer': 'Security deposits are intended to be placed in a designated security or escrow account upon receipt.  Generally, the parties can negotiate for the money to be deposited in an interest earning account.  However, since the landlord is also generally allowed to keep up to 1% of any interest earned as an administrative fee and interest rates are so low, there is usually very little accrued interest to distribute back when the security deposit is returned.'}
