{'question': 'C/O never obtained from previous homeowner before selling the house to us. What can we do???They said they were working on getting final sign off when covid 19 hit... Now it&#039;s been a year since we owned the house and still no C/O...what can we do????', 'answer': 'If you are asking about what you can do with respect to previous owner that you purchased from that depends in large part in what happened at your closing.  DId you agree to close on a handshake that this issue would be taken care of or was there an escrow agreement and funds deposited to secure performance?  If you are asking how to take care of it yourself, that depends on what is outstanding and you may need the assistance of not only an attorney but a contractor, engineer and/or expeditor too.'}
