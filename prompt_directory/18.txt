{'question': 'I paid first month rent and security deposit before i moved in.  Can they use my security deposit for 2nd month?I am having a problem with my bank account due to fraud, I am wondering if management can use the security deposit I gave before I moved in for this month that I owe rent on.', 'answer': 'Dear Bronx Tenant  \n \nNo. You are not entitled to consume the entire amount of the Tenant Security Deposit to pay current rent, your landord is not allowed to confiscate the security deposit to pay current rent.  \n \nIn 2019 the NYS Legislature totally overhauled the NYS Tenant Security Deposit statute. The objective was to provide a uniform law for protecting Tenant and Landlord and to assure the best possible solutions for the most important safeguards were in place. Your desire to use the security deposit to pay current rent conflicts with the words and spirit of the Statutory scheme.'}
