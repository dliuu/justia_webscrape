{'question': 'Ex-partner and myself is on mortgage; how do I go about removing my name?We separated two years ago, and part of our agreement was for me to move out, and she&#039;ll retain the home, as long as she can maintain the monthly payments. At the time of agreement, I didn&#039;t have the resources to do things the RIGHT way and wanted the path of least resistance to just take my loss and start over, alone. The plan was for her to find &quot;someone&quot; who she can refinance with eventually, that way I&#039;m no longer tied to the situation.  \n \nThat said: I&#039;m in a predicament now where the bank collection dept. has contacted me about a 60 delinquent account [last payment was 2/3/2020]. I&#039;ve reached out to my ex twice via email, to no avail. \n \nI need to know the next best course of action, legally.', 'answer': 'What you have not confirmed is whether you are on title as well as the loan.  If on title, bring a partition action to sell the property by court order, and in turn, pay off the loan.  That may also force her to refinance.  If there is no equity in the property, there is little you can do, but let the property be sold.  You are likely to never have to pay anything, but you will take the hit to your credit score.'}
