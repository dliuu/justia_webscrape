{'question': 'Can a co-op board elect themselves at the annual election meeting because no new candidates announced their candidacy?Our by-laws dictate that the board must have an annual election meeting to elect board members. Because no new candidates announced their candidacy, the board decided not to hold the elections at the meeting and the current Board will remain until the next year. \n \nThe by-laws do have strict language to have an election meeting, how to conduct the vote and vote counting, but it does not say anything about the announcement of candidates.  \n \nThe board is of the opinion that because they gave the shareholders  a 10 day notice to announce their candidacy and no one responded, that therefore the absence of new candidates  automatically elected the current incumbents to a new term. \n \nIs the board in violations of the by-laws?', 'answer': 'In order to give an accurate answer, the By-Laws would have to be reviewed.  Some By-Laws will allow the current board to remain in place until a meeting with the proper quorum is present to hold elections or other variations that could make your Board&#039;s actions go either way.'}
