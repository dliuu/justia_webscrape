{'question': 'Do I have to leave or can the new owners buy me out? I have no place else to go.I’m renting a room in a private house, no lease agreement only verbal. Owner hasn’t told me but heard he sold house. What are my rights in this situation, I have no place to go and been paying my rent faithfully. Please I need help.', 'answer': 'If a property is sold, the new owner essentially steps into the shoes of the previous owner and does not have more rights than the previous owner with respect to existing tenancies.  In New York, a landlord must commence a case in Housing Court to obtain possession of a rental unit from a tenant.  That means that tenant can&#039;t be locked out without an order/judgment from the Court.   \n \nYou mentioned that you are renting a room in a private house.  Many times such rentals are not legal but that does not mean you do not have the rights I&#039;ve described.  If you feel threatened or harassed there are steps you can take to protect yourself.  Ultimately, having a lawyer to stand up for your rights might get you the best result.'}
