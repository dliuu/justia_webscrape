{'question': 'My mother (90) owns her home in Huntington.  She would like to add her 2 daughters to the title.  What is the process?Can we do this by completing a form or do we need to get a lawyer? Can we file electronically?  I live in Maryland, but her house is in New York. Thank you.', 'answer': 'You should have a lawyer.  There are recording fees of a few hundred dollars.  I charge $500 plus the recording fees.  You need a deed and tax forms.'}
