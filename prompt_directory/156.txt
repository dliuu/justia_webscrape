{'question': 'Our landlord is threatening to evict us if we don&#039;t replace siding on the house ( it was off before we moved in) Can he?Moved in Aug 2019; siding was off long before we got here. Contract states we are responsible for repairs and maintainence; but I would assume siding would not be included. It is going to cost upward of $5,000 to do this. He also wants us to repair the roof ( which was also damaged before we moved in) this is after we already replaced all plumbing, heating, electrical, flooring, etc.', 'answer': 'Unless a tenant the protection of an existing lease or is a rent regulated tenant, the landlord does not need cause to terminate a tenancy.  However, if a tenant has complained about conditions that require repair and the landlord is acting in retaliation for good-faith complaints, the tenant may temporarily receive some protection from a retaliatory eviction.'}
