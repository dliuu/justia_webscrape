{'question': 'NY Chap 7 dischrg in 2019 still residing in home in foreclosure awaiting auction. still have the right to file chap 13??Queens, NY asked on November 4, 2022 in Bankruptcy and Real Estate Law for New York', 'answer': 'You are able to file a Chapter 13 in this situation.   However, you may not receive a Discharge in this new Chapter 13 case because you may have received a Discharge in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filed within the prior 4 years.    Even if you cannot receive a Discharge, you can still file a Chapter 13 to stop the foreclosure process and set up a payment plan to deal with the mortgage arrears.   You should contact a bankruptcy attorney to discuss how to best use the Chapter 13 process to stop the foreclosure.  The attorney can also determine when you are eligible to receive a Chapter 13 Discharge.'}
