{'question': 'Is there a way to tell if a real estate selling agent is legitimately raising the asking price of a house?I was interested in a house that came on the market for $230K. After viewing, I made an offer. A few days went by and my agent said the seller had a better offer, so I offered more than the alleged other buyer offered. Again, I was contacted and told the other buyer had topped my offer. I again had to raise my bid. I eventually bought the house for $288K, but felt the selling agent was just saying there were better offers to get the price up. I asked my agent and she said that that are regulations that prevent that, but I don&#039;t know about those things.', 'answer': 'Lying to pump up a selling price is criminal fraud, and the broker will lose a license. But usually, it is not a good claim to make after you established as a matter of law a &#039;meeting of the minds&#039; when you accepted the proposed selling price. It is a bit late to question the purchase price. You should have discussed this with your attorney before entering into the contract.'}
