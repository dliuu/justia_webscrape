{'question': 'how do I go about starting adverse possession /obtain deed on attached  lot?Bought a home 10 years ago.  Title company at our closing found that attached lot was never transferred to previous owner some 30 years prior.   The lot was mistakenly put in previous owner.s name.   Previous owner used as a yard , cared for it, and paid taxes on it for 30 plus years (tacking).  I continued that practice.  Woman named on title died 70 years ago with no known heirs. \nHow can I finally get this lot in our name and receive a deed for it?', 'answer': 'It appears that you are looking for info for DIY adverse possession claim.  Although the desire to avoid legal fees is understandable, it is a difficult case to do yourself.  It is also possible that you could inadvertently make admissions that would undermine your case.
