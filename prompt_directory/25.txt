We are building our credit currently and we don&#039;t have anyone to co sign for us. My brother said we can make monthly payments for the house. What kind of paperwork would I need drawn up and does all 3 of them need to sign it and does it need to be notarized also at the end of the agreement how do we go about switching the title to our name?', 'answer': 'Unfortunately, real estate transactions between family members that are done informally without an attorney often result in disputes down the road.  Therefore, it is important to obtain legal representation to properly document this proposed transaction and best protect yourself instead of asking what paperwork you need.'}
