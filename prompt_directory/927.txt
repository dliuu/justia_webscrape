{'question': 'Can i get sued for unpaid rent even if im not in the lease, never had a written agreement i was just helping to pay rentI was a guest helping my boyfriend pay his rent ( it was at a property him and his sister shared ) and now i am getting sued for unpaid rent by his sister , even though i was never on the lease, we never had a written/ verbal agreement that i would pay every single month. Then she kicked me out and expected me to pay rent after I left. Is this legal?', 'answer': 'No. It is not legal. Only a person who made a rental agreement is legally liable to pay rent. Eviction without a court order is a crime.'}
