{'question': 'My Mom recently passed and she owns a co-op in brooklyn that she is leaving to her 4 children.She has a will.The co-op board says we have to purchase her co-op then be approved first before we can sell it. and there are fees involved of course and we need to hire a lawyer. Is this legal?', 'answer': 'If the will leaves the property to the four siblings, you do not have to &quot;purchase&quot; the coop but it may need to be transferred to your name before it can be transferred to a third-party purchaser.  It is likely that you will need a New York attorney to probate your mother&#039;s will and sort out what the actual legal requirements for transferring the interest in the coop unit will entail in your specific situation.'}
