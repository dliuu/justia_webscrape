{'question': 'As a home owner do I have to pay for broken damaged appliances caused by my tenant?I am a home owner and when my tenant moved in, all appliances including ceiling fan was in excellent working safe condition. Last summer I had to replace the ceiling fan because he was being too rough with it that the wires got disconnected. Now the oven door frame is broke (looks like it was ranked off the screws). He is very rough in the way he handles things. I need to know if he breaks these items due to his negligence, do I have to pay for repairs/replacement?', 'answer': 'If the tenant is responsible for paying for any damage caused to your property. Therefore, you can ask him to pay for repair or replacement of the item. If he refuses to pay, you may deduct from his security deposit or take him to small claims court. However, the court may only award you an amount equal to the value of the item. For example, the court might award you only the depreciated value of the stove.'}
