{'question': 'My Mom recently passed and she owns a co-op in brooklyn that she is leaving to her 4 children.She has a will.The co-op board says we have to purchase her co-op then be approved first before we can sell it. and there are fees involved of course and we need to hire a lawyer. Is this legal?', 'answer': 'Welcome to New York Real Estate.  Get a copy of the co-op&#039;s rules.  Talk to a NY probate/real estate lawyer.  You need someone to review the rules, and then possibly bully the coop to allow sale and transfer.'}
