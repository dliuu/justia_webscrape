{'question': 'We just sold our farm (not our permanent residence). Most equipment was still in barns and new owners said no hurry.Papers are signed and new owners say everything is theirs if each item had not been specified as ours. Do they now own our things?', 'answer': 'You will need to carefully review the terms and conditions of the contract. Generally, any personal properties must be removed out of the premises prior to the transfer of the ownership (usually the closing date) unless otherwise stated in the contract. If any non-fixture items are left on or after the closing date, you can be held in default of the contract. If the contract says anything left will be deemed abandoned, then the new owner may argue that your items were abandoned and thus they can dispose of the same the way they prefer.'}
