{'question': 'What needs to be done when there&#039;s a life estate on a property, the life tenant dies &amp; owes $ to a rehab nursing center?Hello, \n \nMy father died in early January of this year. He held a Life Estate on his home and my sister is listed as the remainderman on the deed. We filed the death certificate with the Town of Riverhead. \n \nMy father owes a large sum of money to the rehab nursing center he was in when he died; a sum of money larger than all of his other assets. We have not recorded a new deed in the county clerk&#039;s office. Is the house at risk due to the money owed to the nursing center? Should we record a new deed as soon as possible? \n \nThank you, \n \nBasil', 'answer': 'Once the life tenant dies, the property passes by operation of law to the stated remainderman.  Thus, the property is not in your father&#039;s estate.  The issue is who is responsible for the bill.  Usually, someone would sign the admission agreement.  If it is you or your sister, they will come for you.'}
