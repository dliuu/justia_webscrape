{'question': 'Real Estate issueHi I’m reaching out for advice because I don’t know what to do. I’m currently living in a brownstone with my daughter in NYC where I was born, raised, and lived the majority of my life. It is my grandmothers brownstone who also grew up here. My grandmother, who I love with all my heart, unfortunately passed away last year and now my aunts who have done nothing to help while she was alive and only ever cared about my grandmothers money have swooped in to sell her brownstone. They told me it will be gone in 2 weeks while I am still living here with my daughter. I have nowhere else to go and it is devastating for me to lose the home I love more than anything. On top of the tremendous loss of my grandmother, I’m now on the verge of being homeless with my daughter because our home is going to be taken away from us. Is there anything I can do to save our home?', 'answer': 'This is a question for a probate/estate attorney.  Feel free to contact me, as my office handles these types of matters regularly.'}
