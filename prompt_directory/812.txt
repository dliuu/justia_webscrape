{'question': 'Florida short term vacation rental will not reimburse my stay even after governor issued state of emergency &amp; travel banHoneoye Falls, NY asked on June 25, 2020 in Real Estate Law for New York', 'answer': 'Addendum - Many contracts will include forum selection clauses. They can dictate terms as to what forum will be used to resolve disputes or what jurisdiction&#039;s courts will be used. If you are going to invest in a consult with an attorney, check if the contract has a forum selection clause stipulating which state&#039;s laws will apply - it would make sense to consult with an attorney in that state, as the laws of that state would govern. Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
