{'question': 'Does a landlord in NY State have to serve notice to quit/cure prior to filing petition Holdover Recover Real Property?Serving a 30 day notice together with rent demand isn&#039;t sufficient service to then proceed with a Holdover petition to Recovery Real Property? No notice to Cure or Quit ?', 'answer': 'A rent demand is served in connection with starting a nonpayment case not a holdover proceeding.  Since landlord&#039;s that are self represented are held to the same standards as those who retain counsel, avoid being penny wise and pound foolish and hire a local attorney to assist you with your landlord tenant case.'}
