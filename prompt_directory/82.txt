{'question': 'If you sign a real estate contract but tell your lawyer not to send it and they do, is that contract enforceable?My elderly father signed a contract that had no closing date. His lawyer did not tell him either. He signed the contract then instructed the lawyer to NOT send it to the buyer yet. He did so both verbally and through text. Is there any legal recourse? Is the contract valid if the lawyer went against the client&#039;s wishes?', 'answer': 'Based on your post, the remedy appears to be against the lawyer for sure, however, the contract may be void entirely, depending on the content of the messages and how it was sent.'}
