{'question': 'Hello. How can I protect real estate assets purchased from personal money ?My husband and I take a set amount of personal money and put the rest of our pay in a joint account. I would like to use my personal money to purchase real estate that I will put under an LLC. If we get divorced, how can I protect these real estate investments from becoming marital assets that need to be split?', 'answer': 'It&#039;s unclear what you are actually asking.  Generally, investors hold real estate in the name of a corporation or LLC to protect against personal liability.  If you are asking a different question, it would help to be a bit more clear.'}
