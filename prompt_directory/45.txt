{'question': 'Does the law prohibit a landlord of a rent stabilized  \nNYC building to accept one year payment in advance plus securityfrom a tenant who otherwise would be rejected because of insufficient credit?', 'answer': 'Prepayment of rent is prohibited for both a rent-stabilized and market apartment.  This would be considered a security deposit, which is limited to one month.  The penalty would be twice the amount you collect.  Ask your tenant to get a lease guaranty with a company that provides it.'}
