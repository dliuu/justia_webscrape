{'question': 'Is it legal for my landlord to use a window (not open) to enter my home while we are away? \nHe lost his keyThis is an email the landlord sent while I was away. Is this legal to do for him? The reason is that he have lost his key. \n \n&quot;We did test the boiler for the third time this morning and it started up without hesitation.  I left the heat on so it should be warm when you arrive.  I did have to find a way into your house through the front kitchen window - sorry but I had no choice as the thermostat had to be calibrated. And sorry again as I left some dirt in the kitchen.&quot;', 'answer': 'It is not lawful for the landlord to enter into your apartment in the way that you have described. As a tenant, you have exclusive possession of the space that you are paying rent for. If the landlord would like to get access to your apartment, the landlord has to request reasonable days for access. In an emergency situation, the landlord does not have to obtain your consent to enter your premises.'}
