{'question': 'Being sued along with tenant for a dog attack. Am I responsible?I&#039;m a landlord in FL with a property in NY. The suit claims that my tenant&#039;s dog attacked a minor. It wasn&#039;t in the lease but we had verbally told the tenant that no pets are allowed. Am I still liable for the damages caused? What are our next steps?', 'answer': 'Youâ€™re in luck. Under current New York State case law, a dog bite victim can only hold someone liable who either owned or harbored the dog. In your fact scenario, the landlord did neither. He simply owned the building where a tenant resided who owned and harbored the dog. it is very unlikely that a court would hold the landlord liable under this fact pattern.'}
