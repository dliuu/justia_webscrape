{'question': 'I paid first month rent and security deposit before i moved in.  Can they use my security deposit for 2nd month?I am having a problem with my bank account due to fraud, I am wondering if management can use the security deposit I gave before I moved in for this month that I owe rent on.', 'answer': 'No! The security deposit is your money that the landlord gets to hold in trust. The 2019 changes of the law would not allow the landlord to use your security deposit for rent without your consent. When you leave, the landlord must deduct the amount of damages and return the rest in 14 days. You cannot use the security deposit to satisfy the second month&#039;s rent without the consent of the landlord.'}
