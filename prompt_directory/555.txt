{'question': 'Can a failure of payment from a PA judgment be recorded as a lien in NY?Judgement if lawyer fees from a contempt in custody. He hasn&#039;t paid anything and won&#039;t pay. After I get a judgement for contempt again, can the PA judgment be recorded against his house in NY?', 'answer': 'Yes, but it is not automatic. The creditor has to start an action in NY to confirm the PA judgment. Then it will become a lien in NY.'}
