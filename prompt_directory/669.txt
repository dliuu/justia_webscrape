{'question': 'Are my sister &amp; her husband obligated to share the proceeds of the sale of my late mother&#039;s home in New York State?My elderly mother sold her house in 2019 to move a few miles so she&#039;d be closer to my sister. My brother in law (a CPA) put the proceeds from the sale (&gt;$100K) in a bank account in my nephew&#039;s name to hide the $ from the govt in case Mom went into a nursing home. He then bought a house near he &amp; my sister, taking out a mortgage on it which was also in my nephew&#039;s name (nephew knew &amp; agreed) where Mom lived until she passed away recently.  Mom died intestate.  My brother in law is now saying that A - the house belongs to them because it was in their names (ostensibly to protect it in case of Mom going into a home) and that they have no intentions of selling it, and B - that they are not obligated to give my brother &amp; I one red cent of the money from the sale of Mom&#039;s original home.  My brother in law says my brother &amp; I should simply split Mom&#039;s savings account (&lt;$20K).  To clarify, Mom was a widow with 3 adult children. Is this legal?', 'answer': 'It is legal.  In fact, without you undertaking expensive and likely unsuccessful litigation, it is the way it is supposed to be.  The recorded documents say what they say.'}
