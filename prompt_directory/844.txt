{'question': 'Is it feasible to open a home business in NY as a recording studio that takes up less than 25% of my home?Hello, I am looking to start a home business in NYC. I researched and it seems to be possible under the Multiple Dwelling Law, due to the creative nature of the business (a home recording studio for music producers). It will take up less than 25% of my home and only one person will be in at a time. Separately, I understand there are laws against short term rentals in place. I had the thought of renting out with the studio if I ever left town for a few days, with my home dwelling as a secondary resource to the music producer. \n \nDoes this sounds feasible from a legal perspective?', 'answer': 'This is a relatively in-depth question that would need some research and additional details from you. You would need to check building rules, bylaws, zoning, multiple dwelling law compliance (if applicable), rent regulatory rules (if applicable) etc. Most likely though it is not permitted if you rent or are in a multiple dwelling based on the facts provided.'}
