{'question': 'I&#039;ve been without full power in my mobile home because park management will not do electrical repairs and I was told it&#039;It&#039;s a dangerous situation and I have no hot water or cooking stove', 'answer': 'It depends. If you own the mobile home and there is an electrical problem in the home, you are responsible for getting it repaired. If you rent the mobile home, the owner is responsible. If the problem is outside the home, the park manager or power company would be responsible for the repair, depending on what kind of problem it is.'}
