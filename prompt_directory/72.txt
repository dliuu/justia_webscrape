{'question': 'Is it legal for my landlord to use a window (not open) to enter my home while we are away? \nHe lost his keyThis is an email the landlord sent while I was away. Is this legal to do for him? The reason is that he have lost his key. \n \n&quot;We did test the boiler for the third time this morning and it started up without hesitation.  I left the heat on so it should be warm when you arrive.  I did have to find a way into your house through the front kitchen window - sorry but I had no choice as the thermostat had to be calibrated. And sorry again as I left some dirt in the kitchen.&quot;', 'answer': 'You could file a complaint of trespass, and burglary with the local police precinct [https://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article140.php#p140.00]. Your landlord&#039;s email, at a minimum, is a confession/admission of the crimes. A criminal does not exculpate himself by saying I&#039;m sorry, but I felt I had to do so. \n \nYou could declare that the non-emergency entry (which would be the same problem if the landlord used the key to enter without your advance permission or prior notice of a need to do so) ended your lease and you move out.'}
