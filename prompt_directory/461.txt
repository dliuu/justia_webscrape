{'question': 'I own a barbershop/salon the landlord wants 2 months of rent I&#039;m suffering by the COVID19 Virus what is the best option?Staten Island, NY asked on May 17, 2020 in Real Estate Law, Business Law and Landlord - Tenant for New York', 'answer': 'Pursuant to Governor Cuomo&#039;s Executive Order, the moratorium on evictions has been extended to August 20th, so there is no immediate threat of eviction.  However, the Executive Order does not relieve a tenant&#039;s obligation to pay rent....  It just temporarily removes the ability of the landlord to evict because of it.  Ultimately, individual tenants will have to negotiate with their landlords that hopefully allows them to catch up on arrears and keep their rental units.  Some landlords may forgive a portion of the past due rent but they are not currently under an obligation to do so.  Business owners can and should investigate government programs, such as PPP to obtain financial assistance.'}
