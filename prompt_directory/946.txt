{'question': 'My mother passed away and had 4 children. What&#039;s the easiest process to get her house sold and have proceeds split?The house is in her name, her live-in boyfriend has a few bills in his name but not on the house. \nShe did NOT have a will.  \nThe house is in semi-okay condition. It needs a lot of work. I would like to know how/when I should get the process started for putting her house on the market and how to price it. Then what kind of paperwork is needed for this and for splitting the money among her heirs considering she doesn&#039;t have a will to execute. I also want to know if it would be easier to put the condition of the house into the &quot;selling price&quot; so it can be sold quicker? I want to make this as easy and quick as possible, it&#039;s been a hard process so far. I do not live in New York anymore so I am not able to do as much being out-of-state.  \n Any help is appreciated.  \nThank you.', 'answer': 'A proceeding must be filed in Surrogate&#039;s Court to have an Administrator appointed as fiduciary of the estate.  The Administrator can have the house sold and divide the proceeds. \n \nRegarding the sale of the house, Have a free telephone consultation with counsel. \n \nJack'}
