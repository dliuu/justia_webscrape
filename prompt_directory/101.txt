{'question': 'My landlord is threatening me because I reported the tenants upstairs for dealing drugs. What can I do?The letter states that my landlord will violate my and my brother&#039;s lease because I have reported the tenants upstairs to the police because they deal drugs out of their apartment. Because I witnessed a favorite tenant of the landlord&#039;s buying drugs from one of the drug dealers upstairs, both of us are now not only being harassed by the drug dealers above us,  but by the landlord&#039;s favorite tenant and their friends. The drug dealers have also hacked my phone with Spyware to monitor emails, texts and calls. Both of us keep getting sick from the chemicals the drug dealers use for cooking drugs inside their apartment and from them smoking the drugs. And these dealers are not the first addicts and dealers we&#039;ve been forced to deal with since we moved here. I am on disability, and this living situation is greatly effecting it, yet disability said they can&#039;t help. The area where we live is small, so finding unbiased help against the landlord is difficult, and we can&#039;t afford to move.', 'answer': 'You may want to contact the Tenant Harassment Prevention Task Force \nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-and-information/thpt.page'}
