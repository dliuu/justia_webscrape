{'question': 'Hi, I&#039;ve put my apartment on Airbnb and curious how I should split the profit with my boyfriend.I got the apartment(lease) by my self and lived there for a year by myself, I put down deposit, I paid a guarantor fee every month, decorated and bought all the furniture, I am doing all the daily maintenance of the Airbnb account and finding cleaner, photograper etc. My boyfriend moved in a year ago and have paid half the rent since. I don&#039;t have a TIN or SSN so I need him to do the Airbnb. How should we split the profit? \n \nI am paying a high monthly fee and 2k when moving in to have a guarantor which let me get the lease by myself without SSN.  \nThe reason to split it at all is cause I want to be fair to him, he has paid 50% rent for the last few months and we need his SSN/tin to post the Airbnb. Everything else is on and thanks to me.', 'answer': 'Your question raises some questions.  Is your BF on the Lease?  I am not sure how you obtained a Lease without a SSN, so I am not sure why that matters now.   Also, does your landlord, municipality, and building permit short term rentals like AirBnB?  Why is he entitled to any &quot;profit.&quot; \n \nI feel like you have put the cart before the horse on this \n \nGood Luck,'}
