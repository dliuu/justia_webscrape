{'question': 'What happens after you default mortgage 120 daysBrooklyn, NY asked on February 3, 2023 in Foreclosure and Real Estate Law for New York', 'answer': 'New York is a judicial foreclosure state, which means that a creditor-sale of a piece of residential real property cannot happen without a court order. The lender first needs to provide you with certain pre-foreclosure notices, and then ultimately file a summons and complaint and serve you with it.  \n \nThe case then moves to mandatory mediation, and ultimately if a loan modification is not worked out, the lender will need to file a motion to obtain a court order to sell the property. Homeowners in New York generally have a significant amount of time to address any mortgage default, but you need to take the appropriate steps to preserve all of your rights .  \n \nAs with many significant legal issue, I would certainly recommend contacting a qualified attorney to deal with any mortgage default.'}
