{'question': 'Being sued along with tenant for a dog attack. Am I responsible?I&#039;m a landlord in FL with a property in NY. The suit claims that my tenant&#039;s dog attacked a minor. It wasn&#039;t in the lease but we had verbally told the tenant that no pets are allowed. Am I still liable for the damages caused? What are our next steps?', 'answer': 'Whether you are responsible will depend on whether you had any notice that there was a dog on the premises and knowledge that the dog had vicious propensities (which would make its attack foreseeable).  If you had no knowledge that the tenant had a dog, no less a vicious one, you would arguably not be legally responsible for any harm caused by the dog.  https://casetext.com/case/strunk-v-zoltanski  Best to report the matter to your homeowner&#039;s insurance and let them handle it.'}
