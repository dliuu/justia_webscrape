{'question': 'what are the pros and cons of land lease buildingsi have to move. i saw a coop in my budget but dont want to get into some deal that comes back to bite me in a few years', 'answer': 'Unlike the usualy situation where a coop owns the land that its building is contructed on, a private land lease arrangements mean the coop essentially leases the land that its building sits upon.  When that land lease expires, the owner of the land can negotiate and obtain a large increase in the rent for the underlying lease.  As a result of the uncertainty regarding future costs, coop unit prices tend to drop significantly as the end of the land lease expires due to uncertainty and expected rising costs.'}
