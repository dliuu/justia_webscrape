{'question': 'My father passed away in NYC with no will in April he left a property in Pennsylvania which is really my aunts becauseHe Helped her with his credit we know the house is my aunts and we want to leave it in her name what do we need to do? We don’t have much money for lawyers fees and all that my aunt is 57 and lost her job due to the pandemic but she doesn’t want to lose her house what forms can she fill out and where in NYC or PA? Thank you in advance to whom ever can answer our question', 'answer': 'Having not done proper planning in advance, there are no shortcuts here.  If this is your father&#039;s only asset, you can likely hire a PA attorney to do a non-domicilliary administration proceeding.  If there assets in NY, even small, then you need to do an administration here, and a ancillary proceeding in PA.  There is no deadline, but title should be cleaned up.'}
