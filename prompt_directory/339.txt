{'question': 'how long can a attorney, hold a probate/ will without notifying any of the benificeraries or any amounts or findings?its been 6 years already and he obviously had no intention of notifying the beneficiarys that everything was completed nor did the executor, something is very fishy, I contacted the attorney and asked for all papers he said I will try to get things together, Said its been 6 years he said I really have no answer why we have not completed all this or contacted all the beneficiaries.', 'answer': 'Generally, the Executor and not the lawyer is responsible for administering the Estate.  Real question is why hasn&#039;t the Executor taken action.'}
