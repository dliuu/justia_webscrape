{'question': 'we have sold our apartment and we have $10,000 in escrow account.Buyers are not releasing our money, stating that we have to fix windows, we have to provide 4 new Air conditioners and we have to provide 2 custom closets that was never there. Our lawyer is holding the money and says that he is not going to finish this case, since he finish with his part at closing and he needs to pay extra if he needs to proof that they are wrong.  Buyer calling me everyday and changing her mind about releasing the money.  48 hours passed and we didn&#039;t receive anything from their lawyer. I really don&#039;t know, whom should we speak for the clearance. we also have a contract that says nothing about custom closets or building windows.', 'answer': 'If there is not consent to release the money, you are going to have to bring a lawsuit.  If the deposit is $10,000, it can be small claims.  Name the lawyer holding the money, and the buyers.  You do not need a lawyer.'}
