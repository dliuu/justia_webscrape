{'question': 'I recorded a lien on a home for $400k for money Iâ€™d given that was not returned,foreclosure now,Iamserved as defend. Y?A person I knew asked for a $400k investment with the promise of a return. Never materialized. Waited substantial amount of time before recording a lien for the $400k on his home in 2008. He would not answer the entire time so I waited. And now I was served papers last night and I am named as a defendant along with the person,his wife, also Bank of America is a defendant against the Plaintiff who is Wells Fargo. Is it only because I have a recorded lien? I have no other dealings with them. Am I going to now get my money back with this action?', 'answer': 'I agree with Mr. Nelson as to why you are a defendant in this case, and what will result.  However, as a matter of law, you cannot just record liens on property because you think you are owed money.  Thus, I am not sure what you did, and how you did it.  The problem is that there is a statute of limitations on suing for the loan proceeds, and you do not want to have done this wrong.'}
