{'question': 'Can my parents gift equity of the home we are buying from them to our son as well?My husband and I can get gifted $16,000 each and from each parent without triggering any gift tax. The total gifted equity amounts to $100,000. If we can include our son as well then we could have $96,000 untaxed.', 'answer': 'You are missing a key concept.  There is a unified credit.  There is no gift tax on any amount in this range.  You are mixing lifetime giving with annual giving.  If you have no idea what I am talking about, get a good lawyer or accountant for whatever you are doing.'}
