{'question': 'I have a question regarding my mothers house I will be inheriting.My mom passed away on 1/31/23, she had no will. At the time of her death she had a Mortgage with 219K left to pay off and 60k in credit card debt, and only 4k in savings. I would like to keep the house so I payed off her credit cards. By negotiating with the lenders I was able to reduce the 60k debt down to 30k. As administrator to her estate which is currently in probate, I have continued paying the mortgage and property taxes, all with my own money. I have the funds to pay off the mortgage completely, but I am wondering if it is possible to negotiate down the mortgage in a similar way to the credit card debt. Should/could I let the mortgage lapse like I did with my moms credit cards, then try to negotiate a lump some payoff with the lender?  \n \nBest Regards, \n \nRobert R', 'answer': 'No.  If there is equity, the bank will not take less, and you will be paying default interest, attorneys fees and other costs.  The credit cards are different as there is really no way to collect so they take a good deal.'}
