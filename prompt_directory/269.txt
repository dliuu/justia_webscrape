{'question': 'Is a houseshare agreement the same as a lease in New York state?I had a houseshare agreement, not a standard lease. However, the new law from 2019 states that security deposit must be returned within 14 days. It is now well past 14 days, but my original lease from February 2019 states she has 30 days to return my security deposit. Since we signed a new lease for a year in 2020, does the law apply to me? She&#039;s trying to charge me for things within normal wear and tear. Does the new law apply to me and is she automatically in default because it has been passed 14 days and I am automatically allowed to get 100% of my security deposit back?', 'answer': 'You shouldn&#039;t count on any time periods for notice being enforced during the Covid crisis.'}
