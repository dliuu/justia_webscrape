{'question': 'hi im from new york. i was set to move into my apartment on 2/1/20. the landlord couldnt meet me so i signed the lease 12/2/21/ which the landlord told me the apartment was all set to move in . here we are going into 2/5/21 and i still have not received my keys or heard from the landlord. even though i signed a lease can i ask for my money back?? by time i move in it will be 2/7/21 at the earliest and then i will owe rent 2.5 weeks later. how is that right?', 'answer': 'Failure to deliver possession may be a justification for terminating your lease; however, it depends on the specific language in your lease.  Regardless of when the landlord is able to deliver possession to you, the tenant should be entitled to a rent abatement for any rent due before granted possession.'}
