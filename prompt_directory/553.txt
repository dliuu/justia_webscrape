I file a claim against the title insurance, they denied the claim. the sellers refused to reimburse the money. how much litigation going to cost me?', 'answer': 'To me, the fact the title company denied the claim is the key issue.  This is ordinarily a title claim.  The &quot;closing company&quot; is usually the title company, so I am not sure what your distinction is.  If it is a lien of the seller you can sue them.  It would be Supreme Court litigation.  Could cost several thousand dollars.'}
