{'question': 'Does my boyfriend have a claim to a house deeded to me?I purchase a house fresh out of college.  It is deeded to me; my boyfriend co signed on the loan.  We broke up and I asked him to move out.  For 2 + year, he contributed $200.00 to monthly  expenses, while I paid the taxes, furniture etc.  He now wants 50,000 from me.  AM I wrong given the house is deeded to me? I reside in NY  I offered him 2,000 back for what he paid into the expenses for the 2+ years.  I have since refinance the mortgage taking his name of the obligations and can find no cause for him to think he is entitled to anything affiliated with the house', 'answer': 'I am not fully understanding his theory that he would be entitled to anything from you.  Was he paying the mortgage or something other than the $200 for expenses? I canâ€™t imagine $200/month comes close to half the costs to operate a home.  More details may be helpful or you could contact an attorney for a free consultation.'}
