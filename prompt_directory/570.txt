{'question': 'Can I sue a management company  for wrongful charges after the sale of a coop apartment in NYC?I have a brain injury, and live on a disability injury settlement. there was a person at the management company who tried to overcharge me every month, and would send me insults in their monthly statements (I saved all the emails). when I sold the apartment, they told me they can stop the sale if I question the charges. They stole a lot of money, it was during COVID and I was afraid I wouldn&#039;t find another buyer (it took 8 months to sell)', 'answer': 'Greetings: \n \nIf indeed there was this impropriety as you describe, you would certainly have grounds to sue.'}
