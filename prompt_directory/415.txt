{'question': 'my tenant is denying me access in the last month of the lease for a plumber to fix the shower due to COVIDAsked on July 14, 2020 in Landlord - Tenant for New York', 'answer': 'Many people are reluctant to have service people in their homes during the Covid crisis.  If this is an emergency situation, you can commence a court proceeding to compel access.  However, this generally means spending money on legal fees that are difficult or impossible to recover.  Therefore, if you can take temporary measures to address the situation, many landlord&#039;s would exercise that option.'}
