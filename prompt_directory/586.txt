{'question': 'I live in NY State. I have a question regarding the legality of a letter/document.My wife and I own a home together in Orange County NY. Many years back, my wife under duress wrote a letter stating that upon the sale of our home, her mother would receive 1/3 of the profit from said sale. Is this letter legal. It was written as an email and only signed by my wife. The document was not signed by myself or by my mother-in-law, nor was it ever notarized.', 'answer': 'To be enforceable a promise to do something must be supported by a corresponding promise by the other party (e.g. I promise to do A if you promise to do B)--this is often referred to as consideration.  So it is unclear whether the promise to pay an amount of money to your wife&#039;s mother is enforceable by the mother because it is unclear why the promise was made or whether it was supported by consideration.  To the extent it was a binding promise (which is unclear) we also do not have sufficient information to determine whether duress would invalidate an otherwise enforceable obligation.  Duress can render a contract unenforceable, but it depends on the circumstances.  Because this is such a fact-heavy scenario, if you need help determining potential liability related to this real estate or if litigation is expected related to the same, it would be wise to seek counsel here in New York to protect her interests, both financial and legal.'}
