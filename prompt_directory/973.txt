{'question': 'A neighbor of mine lost title to her house in Port Jervis, NY after failing to redeem the tax lien a local investor hadbeen holding on it for two years. What, if any, rights does she retain in her personal effects (family heirlooms, legal documents, jewelry, etc.) that remained in the house after the new owner changed the locks?
