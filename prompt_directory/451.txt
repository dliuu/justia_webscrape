{'question': 'Is there a limit for how long it takes an application to rent an apartment in NYC? Can I get my deposit back if so?It has been 3 weeks since I applied and I am running out of time to find a place. I was told the unit would be available by June 1, which is obviously not happening. I don&#039;t want to miss out on places just to find out I&#039;ve been denied. Help!', 'answer': 'The HSTPA of 2019 gave tenants in NYS substantial new rights.  This includes limiting fees associated with renting an apartment to only $20 for a credit check.  If you were charged additional fees, you may seek to recover them.'}
