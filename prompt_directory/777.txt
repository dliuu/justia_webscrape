{'question': 'My home is in both my name and my late husband&#039;s. He died 10 years ago with no will. All we had was the house.We lived paycheck to paycheck. He had been disabled for 24 years. How do I get the deed in just my name?', 'answer': 'You may not need to. If you are going to sell, Usually the title company will accept a deed granting to the buyer from the surviving spouse with a death certificate. If you do want to change the deed now, you would need to file a new deed along with the death certificate and transfer documents, with the county clerk.'}
