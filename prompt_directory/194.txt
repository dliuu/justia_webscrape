{'question': 'Hi, I received a buyout offer from my landlord, do I&#039;m obligated to answer the letter?I live in a rent stabilized apartment for 14 years and I&#039;m not interested in the offer.', 'answer': 'If you advise the owner in writing that you do not want to be contacted about any buyout offer, the owner cannot contact you about it for 180 days unless you advise the owner in writing at some earlier time that you are interested in discussing a buyout, or unless the Court permits the owner to discuss a buyout offer with you.  If the landlord contacts you with another unwanted buyout offer before 180 days, you can file a claim for harassment.'}
