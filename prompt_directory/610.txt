{'question': 'How do I add my mother to the deed of my home? I want to buyout my ex-husband&#039;s interest in the home &amp; need her on thereI&#039;m going through a divorce and am buying out my husband&#039;s interest in the home. My mom will be my co-borrower. The Bank states that I need to add my mother to the deed first before I am able to apply for a home equity loan. What documents do I need to in order to add her to the deed? I checked the Orange County NY Gov website and there are two forms: RP5217 (Real Property Transfer Report) and TP584 (Combined Real Estate Transfer Tax Return, Credit Line Mortgage Certificate, and Certification of Exemption from the Payment of Estimated Personal Income Tax). I&#039;m not sure which one to use. Any assistance would help. Thank you.', 'answer': 'Both the RP 5217 and the TP 584 need to be prepared and submitted with the deed for filing.  Pay close attention to the grantors (must be the same as the deed from which the ownersâ€™ acquired title) and to the grantees (to ensure you are taking title how you wish).  Consider hiring an attorney, the cost will not be significant, and it may save you headache in the long run (county clerks sometimes reject filings if the forms are not proper).'}
