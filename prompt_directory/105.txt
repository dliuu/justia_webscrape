{'question': 'Can my landlord require proof of my chronic illness to make a repair?The intercom and buzzer for my apartment hasn&#039;t worked in over a year.  My building management has claimed over the same year that they are waiting on a chip to replace the entire system.  In the interim, Ive requested an electrician look at the current system to see if a temporary solution can be achieved. \n \nI told my landlord that I live with a chronic illness that impacts my mobility at times, an that the lack of a working buzzer and intercom is a major inconvenience. \n \nThey are asking for proof of my chronic illness before they take action.  Am I required to provide them with proof?', 'answer': 'NYS Multiple Dwelling Law Sec. 50-a, regulates entrances: doors, locks and intercommunication systems in building that meet the criteria. Your landlord/ management company has to have the intercom and buzzer. The owner should explain why it is taking a year to fix the intercom and buzzer system. File a complaint with HPD to see if they comply within HPD&#039;s time to fix the buzzer system. This is a violation and the management company&#039;s audacity to request your personal health information in order to do what is imposed upon them by statute may be a form of harassment!  Also, the management company is prevented by law from retaliating against you in any way for complaining to HPD.'}
