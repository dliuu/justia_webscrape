{'question': 'Property leased under my name by relativeMe and my sister rented/leased an apartment in NY under my name, I lived there for two years and moved abroad after a couple of years, for education and then for a career. I didn&#039;t talk to her too much because of a falling out we had. She passed away a few weeks ago and I had to go take care of her arrangements, I found out that she never changed the lease back to her name, and had rented the place to some other person, most probably without proper documentation (sublease or something). Now that she&#039;s no more, I am wondering how I can get the lease off of my name, and what would be the best way to resolve it.', 'answer': 'Call the landlord.  As you are abroad, you are basically judgment proof in this country, so the landlord should prefer to have the real tenant on the lease.'}
