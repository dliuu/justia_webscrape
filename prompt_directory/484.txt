{'question': 'I’m a seller, we’re in contract (contingent on finding new home) however, due to the corona we can’t . Can we cancel?I’m a seller, we are selling our home and have been in contract for a few months. We did receive a down payment. The contract is contingent on finding another home, however we have not been successful and the Corona pandemic has halted the search. We want to pull out of the deal and return the down payment.  What can we do?', 'answer': 'Greetings.  It appears you would like to get out of a home sale contract.  You likely have an attorney and your question therefore should be directed to that attorney.  They will know the details of the contract best.  If you do not have an attorney, you must get one.  The attorney will review the contract and see if any of its provisions allow you to cancel the contract, such as provisions that talk about force majeure.  Even if the contract is silent as to the matter, you may nevertheless be able to cancel based on common law principles of contract.  Please note however the best way may be to just have a conversation with the buyers.  Please speak with a good New York attorney for further guidance.  Good luck.'}
