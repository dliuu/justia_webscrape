{'question': 'What is the law when it comes to dividing property amongst four heirs?This focuses on the laws in Puerto Rico. Husband and wife had three biological children. Husband had a daughter from an affair. She was recognized by all as a sibling, even by the wife. Wife died six years ago. Husband left will dividing house equally amongst all four of them. Husband now dies and one sibling says that no it shouldn’t be divided equally. That they are entitled to more proceeds of the house since they are biologically more to both owners of the home. Is this true and basically what is the one daughter entitled to if it is true. For argument sake let’s say the house was sold for $100,000. Thank you', 'answer': 'I&#039;m sorry your question remains open for a week. You could try reposting under Puerto Rico. There&#039;s no guarantee all questions on this forum are picked up, but you might have better chances of a response there, as this looks like it involves laws of Puerto Rico.
