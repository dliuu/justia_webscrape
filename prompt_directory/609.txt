{'question': 'I&#039;m in Ch13, had COVID foreclosure protection, but the bank fraudulently filed &amp; received Termination of Automatic StayWhile under COVID-19-Related Hardship Foreclosure Protection (from 3/25/2021-9/20/2021) which my mortgage company extended to me upon my written request after filing the COVID-19 Hardship Form, their attorneys filed Notice of Motion and Motion for Termination of the Automatic Stay. I was not fully aware of the magnitude of this violation until recently, i.e., that no one was permitted to attempt to foreclose while I was in protection - the whole thing simply &#039;happened&#039; while my Chapter 13 attorney (who should have known about the protection) did NOT challenge the Motion and the Court Order was issued on 9/22/2021, albeit after the expiration of the protection period. I believe the mortgage company likely committed a crime and fraud upon the court, as the court was not told of the foreclosure protection. My attorney should bear some serious responsibility. Currently, I am ending a forbearance agreement (9/1/2023) and the bank will NOT renew. This all seems highly illegal and fraudulent.', 'answer': 'I&#039;m truly sorry to hear about this incredibly stressful situation. In situations where there may have been a violation of court orders or misconduct by your own attorney, it could potentially be beneficial to consult with another attorney to review the specifics of your case and possibly represent your interests moving forward. Under California law, if there was indeed a violation of the automatic stay provision, you might have the ability to file a motion to have the stay reinstated and potentially pursue sanctions against the mortgage company for violating the stay; however, because of the complexity of your situation, I would strongly recommend seeking a consultation with an attorney experienced in both bankruptcy and foreclosure matters as soon as possible to explore the best course of action.'}
