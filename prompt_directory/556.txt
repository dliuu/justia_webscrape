After I get a judgement for contempt again, can the PA judgment be recorded against his house in NY?', 'answer': 'The judgment is recorded in New York.  It is a lien on real estate the same way a NY judgment would be a lien.  For other property, there would need to be a levy by the Sheriff or Marshal, like a NY judgment.'}
