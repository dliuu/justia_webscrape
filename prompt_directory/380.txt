{'question': 'have a boat....park it in our yard, and many here do....landlord says WE cant...but others canwe own trailer, but pay lot rent...our boat is the only one you CANT see driving by...yet we have to move ours and everyone else says they dont?', 'answer': 'Generally Landlord-Tenant relationships are contractual in nature and your lease controls the terms.  Do you have a written lease?  Does it say you can use the area you are referring to to park vehicles, trailers or boats?  If not, the landlord may have the ability to direct you not to keep your boat there.  If you don&#039;t have a lease that protects your tenancy, the landlord may take offense at your refusal to follow his preferences and seek to terminate your tenancy.'}
