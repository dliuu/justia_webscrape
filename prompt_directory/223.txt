{'question': 'A friend paying the rent with his check. Lease is on my name. NYC landlord suspicious.Mid year through the lease, I had to move out but the landlord did not want to break the lease even with three months notification. A friend moved in and has been paying the rent with personal check. The landlord is now suspicious. What can I do?', 'answer': 'If you moved out and had someone not on the lease move in to the apartment and pay rent, you have effectively subleased your apartment.  Most leases prohibit tenants from subleasing without the landlord&#039;s consent.  You ask, &quot;What can I do?&quot;  The answer to that question depends upon what it is you want to accomplish.'}
