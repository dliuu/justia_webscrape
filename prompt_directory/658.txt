{'question': 'My grandparents died and the house is still under their name, I need to put the house in my mother&#039;s name.I also have to change the electric and water to her name and was told I needed an Affidavit.', 'answer': 'A little more complicated.  Assuming the house was held by your grandparents as husband and wife, you need to make an estate for the second to die, and then have your mother be conveyed the house as next of kin.  If she has siblings, they need to sign off.'}
