{'question': 'Am I violating my lease? Can I be evicted?My boyfriend spends 4 or 5 nights out the week with me and then goes to his house for 3 or 4 nights. He does not live here, this isn’t his primary residence. Therefore, he’s not on my lease. In addition, my lease has no guest clause. There’s no specifications on how many nights a guest can spend. Am I violating my lease? Can I be evicted ?', 'answer': 'If you are the only tenant on a lease in NYC, the law allows you to have one roommate even without your landlord&#039;s permission.  This is commonly referred to as the roommate law.  Therefore, even if your boyfriend lived with you it should not be a problem provided just you and he live in the apartment.'}
