{'question': 'Do I have to pay my landlord a fee for breaking my lease if other tenants in the home have made it uninhabitable?Tenants who live in the same home have locked me out of the apartment, made verbal threats, and continually harass me. The home is no longer accessible for me and is threatening my safety.', 'answer': 'If you have a written lease with your landlord, you remain responsible for your obligations, including rental payments, until the lease expires or is terminated with consent of both landlord and tenant.  If you have roommates that you are on the lease with or whom you invited to reside with you, generally you remain responsible to the landlord regardless of disputes you may have with your landlord'}
