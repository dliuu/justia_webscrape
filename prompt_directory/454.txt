{'question': 'how can I get access to my mom&#039;s estate?my mom died and 2 long time family friends got power of attorney before her passing.  they got POA when she was already sick with dementia this was done without me knowing. they put her in a nursing home without me know and wouldn&#039;t tell me where she was until she was there a month and a half. they supposedly paid for 10yr for her to be at the home and she wasn&#039;t there ever a whole year.  and to do that they withdrew $400,000 something thousand from her 401k.  I saw a statement from fidelity when my son was staying in my moms co-op before they threw him out. I&#039;ve done some research and POA has no legal standings once the person dies I am the only child my mom was not married how do I get her bank account, 401k her co-op etc.  I am the next of kin not them do they get to keep everything?   \nI need help and advice on what to do this is not right', 'answer': 'You need to petition to be administrator of her estate and then sue the friends.'}
