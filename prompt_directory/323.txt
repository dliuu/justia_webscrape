{'question': 'Landlord told me to vacate the property due to &quot;roommate conflict&quot;. How do I ensure receiving my security back?My landlord communicated thru a 3rd party (my mother) 10.13/14 to vacate my current rental due to roommate conflict 2 months into a 12 month rental. There is no current conflict, but I have found alternative housing. Everything thus far has been verbal and thru my mother. How do I ensure my security back? You attention and expertise is greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Justin', 'answer': 'It isn&#039;t a good idea to move forward based on a handshake.  If you have a written lease, you may be deemed to remain liable under its terms unless the landlord provides you with a signed, written agreement releasing you and agreeing to refund your security deposit.  In addition, you should have an agreement from your roommate that releases you too to assure no claims will be pursued against you on that front too.'}
