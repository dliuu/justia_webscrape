{'question': 'I am an administrator of a rental property after my partner passed away (previous owner). What rights do I have?I am the partner of the previous owner of the building, who passed away. I am now administrator. I am considering a rent adjustment, transferring responsibility of utilities to the tenants, etc. What rights do I have to make changes? Am I the highest ranking person in charge of the building? I am unsure what my obligations and allowances are in this position and any insight would be helpful. Thank you.', 'answer': 'Your status with respect to the property depends on a number of factors.  For example, do mean business or romantic &quot;partner&quot; and has Surrogate&#039;s Court appointed you as the Administrator?  These and other factors determine the scope of your rights and responsibilities with respect to the property.'}
