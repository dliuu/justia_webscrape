{'question': 'What can I do?My NY buyers attorney drew up sales paperwork stating that my buyer made an Ernest deposit when he didn’t.My attorney says there is nothing I can do. I can’t believe I can be provided with real estate sales paperwork to sign stating that the attorney collected the money when he didn’t. Should I have been informed and what can I do. My buyer backed out of the deal with proven false reasons and my lawyer won’t help.', 'answer': 'Something is fishy.  However, you do not have to return money you do not have.  If the lawyer said money was in escrow and it was not, he can be disbarred.  Escrow accounting is a big deal.'}
