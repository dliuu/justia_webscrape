{'question': 'In 2010 my mother took out a $200K Home Equity Line of Credit on her home in New Jersey to give me a mortgage topurchase an investment property in New york.  There was a signed mortgage note for the loan. The note states the loan is subject to the laws of New York.  In 2014 my sister learned of the loan and coerced mom to requesting repayment.  The building was sold and mom accepted $100K, had the attorney write me a check for $50K and verbally told me she was satisfied.  No one ever mentioned this again and  no one ever asked me for any money related to this.  Mom passed Sept 2021 and my sister is now demanding repayment of the full 200K with interest.  Unfortunately the lawyer never closed out the mortgage note, but it was obvious mom was satisfied with the resolution of the loan at the closing.  She in fact gifted me and my wife 3 acres of property in 2015. Does my sister have any right to a claim on the balance of the loan? We are co executors of mom&#039;s estate.  Thank you for your Time.', 'answer': 'Your sister very much has a claim.  Given a lawyer was involved, this was very sloppy all around.  An interest in real estate can only be altered with a writing.  You have none.  The mortgage remains of record.'}
