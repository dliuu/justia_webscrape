{'question': 'I have a store in queens opened in August 2019 .. I was paying rent before Covid hit .. now I have 4 months rent dueMy landlord sent me a lawyerS  notice and does not want to forgive any rent ... Iâ€™m not even making basic store expenses what to do ...', 'answer': 'Unfortunately, many small business tenants are in the same position you described.  Although there is an Executive Order that places a moratorium on evictions until August 20th, rent payments that became due during the COVID-19 crisis have not been abated and remain due.  My firm has been representing many small business owners in negotiating rent abatements and or rent deferments as well as lease surrenders.  You can attempt to negotiate with your landlord on your own or retain an attorney to do so on your behafl but don&#039;t ignore the issue.'}
