{'question': 'My coop closing was scheduled to first week of may/2020. No board interview yet. Can I cancel the contract &amp; get downpayMy attorney thinks I should not because the pandemic has delayed everything and he can&#039;t guarantee my down payment. Today is 7/23/2020 and we have no idea when we will get a board interview.', 'answer': 'If you used the regular form contract you should be able to get out of it if that is what you want.  Many people are in your situation.  Your lawyer is probably dragging his feet because he/she only gets paid at closing.'}
