{'question': 'My mother died a couple of years ago and left us property in Puerto rico. Because of all the storms property is damagedI live in ny. My aunt tells me that the government is going to demolish the house and take over the property. Can they do that  ?', 'answer': 'I&#039;m sorry for the loss of your mother. This would be governed by Puerto Rico law if the property is situated there. You could repost under Puerto Rico (click the linked text &quot;Show More States&quot;). Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
