{'question': 'Can Landlord enter a house that is rented by several tenants without notice? (State of New York - Long Island)I live at the state of New York (long island), and have rented a house with several other tenants. Each one of us has its own lease contract. My lease contract specifies 24-hour notice for the landlord before entering the house! But my landlord kept entering the house without giving notice. Can she do that? Can I cancel the lease? I have given her several notices via text messages but she says that she can enter the common areas of the house (kitchen, etc.) without notice as long as she has not entered my room!', 'answer': 'Usually, it is improper for a landlord to rent out individual rooms in an apartment to different tenants.  Therefore, the bigger issue may be that the use of your apartment is illegal.'}
