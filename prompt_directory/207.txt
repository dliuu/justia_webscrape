{'question': 'I am subleasing an apartment in NYC and I have been given less than 30 days to leave what are my rights?I had a verbal agreement with someone to sublease their apartment for 1550. I&#039;ve been living here since June 2019 I pay the utilities here also and have bills that come here in my name . I found out that the actual rent for the apartment is 650 because I came home to a letter on the door for non payment of rent (It was just taped to the door not in a n envelope). This is how I learned the apartment was rent stabilized. i have been using zelle to pay them the rent and for utilities. They told me I had to leave by the 30th of September after they learned I had lost my job which is less than a 30 day notice. Is there anything I can do  ive been over paying them and I don&#039;t have any subleasing agreement on paper nor do I think the actual landlord is aware that they are subleasing to me.', 'answer': 'If you want to be accommodating you can comply with the request to vacate by the 30th.  However, if you do not vacate by that date, the prime-tenant or landlord will have to commence a Housing Court case to seek to evict you.  As a result of the Covid pandemic, the eviction process can be even lengthier than usual so you would have ample time to find a newplace.  You may want to consider retaining an attorney to attempt to negotiate a buy-out agreement.'}
