{'question': 'Is it legal or illegal for a realtor to list apt for rent,while people are still living there(their lease is not up)I live in a building managed by a company (although the owners of the building are the same people who own the management company) \nFew months ago we noticed that they were listing apartments for rent on various websites but the problem is that people were still living there,they had no idea (their apartment is listed) and their lease wasn’t even close to being up  \nWe even ask some of them if they plan to move and they said no \nSome said maybe it was a mistake when they saw their apartment listed for rent \nBut it wasn’t  \nWe realized the entire second floor was listed  \nAnd only one apartment was empty and for rent \nAnd the apartments were listed for rent for much much higher price than  all the other apartments in the building  \nSomeone mentioned that to the realtor (that was doing the listing) and the listings just disappeared and he never responded and deleted all listings  \nBut we have some screenshots with the listings \nWe just want to know if this is legal', 'answer': 'Dear Oyster Bay Tenant: \n \nI am not able to locate a specific legislatively created crime for the events you described.
