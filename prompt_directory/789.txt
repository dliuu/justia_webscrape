{'question': 'He Hello I was wondering i am involved  in a scam on craigslist because the thing is the persons offer me a DealHello I was wondering if I am involved  in a scam on craigslist because the thing is the persons offer me a Deal too good to believe and utilities included for $900 a month furnished. Including laundry free an gym. How can I detect if it’s real and not scam ? What should I do. It’s in Manhattan', 'answer': 'I think trusting your gut is correct.  Normally if something seems too good to be real, it is.   There are a number of things you can do to make sure you don&#039;t get scammed:  cross reference the address, google the apt&#039;s agent, never rent sight unseen, and vet the person who is offering the rental.   \n \nCraigslist is overloaded with scammers trying to make a quick buck.  You can always reach out to a law office (I know mine and many others) would assist you in vetting the listing affordably.'}
