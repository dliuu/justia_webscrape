{'question': 'If my father passed away and just his name on the deed are me and my brother entitled to the house if step mom sells it?My father passed away and left everything to my step mom thinking she would help my brother and I but she totally ignores us and is planning on giving everything to her children. I&#039;ve recently been contacted by a lawyer asking my to sign a paper so she can sell the brownstone in brooklyn I refused and she can&#039;t sell it. My father stated in the will he leaves all property to her but her name is not on the deed am I entitled to the property if she passes away or do I have any rights to a portion of the money if I sign the paper and they sell the house. The house is worth about $1,000,000. I don&#039;t understand why the lawyer needs my signature if I have no right to it. Any explanation of this would be helpful.', 'answer': 'If he left &quot;everything&quot; to your step mom and it was just his name on the deed then it&#039;s going to be your step-moms.  If your step-mom passes away her estate is still entitled to the entirety of your dad&#039;s estate.  Without knowing what document the lawyer wants you to sign I can&#039;t say with certainty what rights you may be giving up by signing it, most likely it is a waiver of process for your dad&#039;s estate proceeding.'}
