{'question': 'I live in a non smoking apartment complex. Cigarette smoke in my apartment.This has been going on since the beginning of this year. Landlord said they could not evict anyone because of covid-19. Second hand smoke is considered a health hazard. I had found that the Landlord can evict someone because of a health issue. How can I have my Landlord to honor there non smoking agreement? It is in our lease.', 'answer': 'It has been extremely difficult for landlords to move landlord/tenant cases forward during the Covid-19 pandemic.  For tenants that have filed Hardship Declarations, proceedings are stayed through August 31, 2021, except in very limited cases of extreme nuisance.  Not to suggest that the health hazzards of second-hand smoke are not serious but in NYC most Housing Court Judges would not be likely to consider it as exempt from the moratorium.'}
