{'question': 'Seller refusing to return the downpayment when we backed out before the sellers signed the contractI signed the contract and wired the deposit however sellers weren&#039;t signing the contract for several days and I decided to withdraw as this wasn&#039;t the first red flag. Now they are not responding at all to requests to refund the deposit. Since they didn&#039;t sign the contract, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s binding. What options do I have to get my money back? Is there any legal basis for them to not return the deposit promptly since the contract is not fully executed?', 'answer': 'If the downpayment was deposited before the contract was signed, that is theft.  If it was a check not yet returned, stop payment.  If it was a wire to a lawyer, and the lawyer refuses to return it, file an ethics grievance.  This is theft.'}
