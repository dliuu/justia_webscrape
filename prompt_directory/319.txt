{'question': 'Can a landlord or owner ask pre-screening questions before scheduling a tour of a unit? If so, what can they ask?When I call to set up a tour of an apartment, some people ask about my income, credit, number of people living with me etc. Seems unnecessary to have to answer these when I don&#039;t even know if I like the unit yet. What is the legality to them pre-screening on the phone?', 'answer': 'Similar to how you don&#039;t want to waste time answerin unnecessary questions, many landlords don&#039;t want to waste time showing apartments to prospective tenants who might not meet the criteria need to rent an apartment.  As long as the questions don&#039;t run afoul of any existing laws or amount to lawfully prohibited discrimination, landlords can engage in screening practices.'}
