{'question': 'Can the leasing manager say no to add a roommate in NYC?I signed the lease in NYC. I asked to add my boyfriend as a roommate, and the leasing company said I could not add him because I already signed the lease. \n \nThe lease says it could be used as a residence only for myself and my immediate family, who has been living. But I thought the NYC roommate law covers one person. \n \nCan I send my boyfriend&#039;s name before 30 days? \n \nOr can I defease the contract?', 'answer': 'The roommate law absolutely applies.'}
