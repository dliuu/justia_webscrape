{'question': 'Hi, I&#039;ve put my apartment on Airbnb and curious how I should split the profit with my boyfriend.I got the apartment(lease) by my self and lived there for a year by myself, I put down deposit, I paid a guarantor fee every month, decorated and bought all the furniture, I am doing all the daily maintenance of the Airbnb account and finding cleaner, photograper etc. My boyfriend moved in a year ago and have paid half the rent since. I don&#039;t have a TIN or SSN so I need him to do the Airbnb. How should we split the profit? \n \nI am paying a high monthly fee and 2k when moving in to have a guarantor which let me get the lease by myself without SSN.  \nThe reason to split it at all is cause I want to be fair to him, he has paid 50% rent for the last few months and we need his SSN/tin to post the Airbnb. Everything else is on and thanks to me.', 'answer': 'Dear Brooklyn Tenant  \n \nHello. If your apartment is in a building with at least two more apartments, you must be very careful.  \n \nFirst, your lease may prohibit Airbnb. Most leases in NYC will not allow for use of the apartment for short-term rental. Most leases prohibit profiteering and commercial use.  \n \nNYC requires Airbnb deliver Host information. There are various reasons, but you could look this up &quot;is it legal to Airbnb in NYC&quot;.  \n \nNext, NYC prohibits unhosted short-term rentals as well as advertising the apartment. The financial penalties are severe. The building landlord is subject to fines as well.  \n \nNYC will tax the money earned.  \n \nIf your lease does not allow for short-term rental or if you run afoul of NYC and State Law prohibiting short-term rental  you will face eviction. \n \nA record of a filed eviction lawsuit will likely haunt you and any other person identified by name in the lawsuit. While NYS landlords may not rely on subscription to Tenant Blacklists, other States do not prevent a prospective landlord to deny renting to a person with an eviction history in NYC.'}
