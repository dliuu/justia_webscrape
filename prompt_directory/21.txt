{'question': 'Landlord had no Certificate of Occupancy, paid last months rent to move in and found asbestos in basement ($14000 est)Just found out Landlord never got a C of O and we live here! AND found asbestos which I was disturbing doing laundry! Took last months rent from us as well to move in.', 'answer': 'Dear Rochester Tenant: \n \nYou omitted some information. Is the building a multiple dwelling, or one and or two family house? If a multiple dwelling did the City ever issue a Certificate of Occupancy for the rental property? If one or two is the building also owner-occupied? \n \nhttps://www.cityofrochester.gov/article.aspx?id=8589937560 \n \nYou could request an inspection. I surmise if your dwelling requires a C of O, your rental is illegal.'}
