{'question': 'Paying to stop a marshall&#039;s eviction noticeI got served a Marshall&#039;s 14 day eviction notice. Short story is it&#039;s my own fault I let it get to this state but I definitely want to get this rectified as this has been my home my entire life (rent-stabilized unit since my birth). Can I go down to the landlord-tenant court and bring certified funds to the clerk to have them vacate or cancel the eviction/warant?', 'answer': 'You may go to the Housing Court in the County that issued the warrant of eviction and make an application for an Order to Show Cause (&quot;OSC&quot;) to stay your eviction.  You may bring certified funds payable to the Petitioner to demonstrate to the Court you have the funds available to satisfy the judgment.'}
