{'question': 'I bought a house with a &quot;friend&quot;, realizing too late I&#039;ve been manipulated. Can I &quot;break&quot; our agreement?I should have gotten a lawyer to represent my interests at the time, but our co-homeowner agreement seems very lopsided now. I don&#039;t want to sell or take on another mortgage, but I need some kind of relief from the onerous conditions she keeps imposing. These include limiting my privacy, personal space, &amp; autonomy in my own home, sharing  a very small house with her rotating guests &amp; tenants. It feels like a violation of my civil rights. Thank you for your thoughts.', 'answer': 'If you are both named on the deed, you would be able to commence a partition action to force a sale of the property to free yourself from the situation.'}
