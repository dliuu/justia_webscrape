{'question': 'How can I get forfeited security deposit back (more details below)?I applied for a New York apartment, it was accepted, and I paid the security deposit. The application states that the security is forfeited after 2 weeks if a lease is not signed. This was on March 17th. We had agreed I could sign the lease in mid-April (no exact date). I had decided to go with a different apartment (19 days later, counting non-business days), but to my understanding, the two weeks would begin 14 days before signing the lease, since there was no agreed upon date. Is there a loophole I could find?', 'answer': 'They are taking advantage of you since you are in Anchorage and out of reach of suing in NYC Small Claims Court. There is no such thing as a &quot;security deposit&quot; without the existence of a lease. The two fit as a hand in a glove. Whatever money you paid to hold the apartment for you is not a &quot;security deposit.&quot; A &quot;security deposit&quot; is not paid with an application. A so-called &#039;hold deposit&#039; may be subject to a forfeit if there is full advance written disclosure of the risk involved in refusing to enter into a lease, and the prospective tenant signed a written acknowledgment of that risk.'}
