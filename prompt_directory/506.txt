{'question': 'What rights do I have as a renter during the pandemic?I am locked into a lease until August. Recently, my household income has taken a huge hit due to reduced hours worked and wages earned, and we are struggling to make ends meet. I have always made payments early and have a great history with this company. I contacted my landlord and explained the situation. I was told that nothing can be done and that the full rent is due the 1st of the month. What are my options? I know there is a moratorium for evictions, but what about my credit score? And will I really be sued if I have to break my lease?', 'answer': 'As the COVID-19 crisis continues and because eviction proceedings are currently suspended, many landlords are becoming more flexible in renegotiating lease terms in both residential and commercial settings.  It&#039;s possible that your landlord will be more open to negotiations as time goes on.'}
