{'question': 'My lease is ending soon (rent-stabilized + preferential rent rider in lease). With HSTPA, can my landlord raise my rent?My lease is ending on June 30, 2022. It was for 1 year and 3 months, with the 3 months being &quot;free&quot; due to rental concessions. I am worried that when our landlord gives us the 90 day required notice of renewal on April 1, it will try to increase our rent exorbitantly after looking at current listings for similar units in our building. I have been doing some research and found that under HSTPA of 2019, preferential rent cannot be raised to the legal rent upon lease renewal. There is a preferential rent rider in our lease, but my understanding is that the 2019 changes to the rent laws under HSTPA made all preferential rents permanent, regardless of whether there was a rider in the lease stating otherwise. Additionally, there is a &quot;Tax Benefits&quot; rider in our lease stating that our building is subject the Rent Stabilization Law under 421-a of the Real Property Tax Law. Is my landlord able to increase my rent in the lease renewal beyond the percentage allowed by these laws?', 'answer': 'I&#039;m sorry your question remains open for three weeks. You could try reposting and adding &quot;Landlord-Tenant&quot; as a category. There&#039;s no guarantee all questions will be picked up, but you could have better chances of a response there. Good luck'}
