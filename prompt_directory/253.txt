{'question': 'I own the house, my boyfriend pays utilities.  What rights does he have? He is physically abusive and is a drug addict?I own the house.  He has lived in it with me for two years.  He pays utilities.  I have tried to break up with him but he refuses to leave the house.  He is physically abusive and I just recently found his drug items in the house.  It is not safe for him to live with me anymore but he refuses to leave.  What can I do? What legal rights does he have being that he lived in the house for two years?', 'answer': 'If your boyfriend will not voluntarily vacate and you have not obtained an order from a court excluding him from the residence because of domestic violence or other reasons, you are required to take similar steps as a landlord would to evict him from your home through a holdover proceeding.  Since it can be difficult to live with someone while you are working through the eviction proceeding, you want to be sure you don&#039;t waste time by making a mistake in litigation that you try to commence on your own.  Therefore, I suggest you consider retaining a local attorney to assist you.'}
