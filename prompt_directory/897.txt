{'question': 'My Mother owns a house in New York City . Does my sister and I have to be on the deed to avoid probate when she passes?She wants us to have the house when she passes but she believes by adding us to the deed she’ll lose some of her benefits. I’m unaware of what benefits she can lose. I need this referred to a New York City/State lawyer. I am her son and reside in Florida', 'answer': 'When she passes, if she is unmarried, and you and your sister are the only kids, you would inherit the house.  This would not require a Surrogate Court proceeding.  A will could reinforce this plan.  Adding to the deed does not negate any government benefits.'}
