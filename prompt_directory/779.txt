{'question': 'Will removing real estate from my name before applying for S.S. affect meEast Orange, NJ asked on September 10, 2020 in Real Estate Law for New York', 'answer': 'You might be better off reposting this in the Social Security section - it isn&#039;t really an issue that real estate attorneys deal with. There&#039;s no guarantee all questions are picked up, but you&#039;d have better chances of meaningful input there. Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
