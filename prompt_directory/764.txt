{'question': 'I have a weird question. Can closing/real estate lawyer steal broker commission?New York, NY asked on November 12, 2020 in Real Estate Law for New York', 'answer': '&quot;Steal&quot; is a very strong word with various subjective meanings associated with it. You need to provide more specific factual background of your case.  \n \nIf your RE attorney (usually representing the seller) is supposed to hold the commission for you, then of course, s/he will not be allowed to refuse to tender or expend the money. If, however, you are a self-proclaimed real estate broker for the seller/buyer who claims that services were rendered in connection with the transaction and s/he is thus entitled to some commission, then not getting the commission at closing may not constitute &quot;stealing&quot; by the counsel since you may not be entitled to anything.'}
