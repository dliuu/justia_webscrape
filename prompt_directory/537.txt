{'question': 'My mom passed in the blizzard of 2010.  No will.  House was paid.  Sister lives there still. I&#039;m the oldestAfter 5 years we would sell the house and split the monies.  This sister is a lot shady.  Can my brother and I force her to sell?  I believe she has a felony  \nConviction and we never appointed her executrix.  If we did we never received papers for it what would be our recourse.  She has tried to withdraw whatever Money my mom had in the bank with her girlfriend but was stopped by the bank manager.  Just to give a little insight as to her demeanor.  Mom also received a settlement from a fall which we never saw dime from for $27,000 . I&#039;m sure my mom also had a safe deposit box and Lord only knows what else she is hiding .  My brother and could sure use a little help right now.', 'answer': 'From what you describe it does not appear that an estate proceeding was started or you would have been given notice. You can go to the Surrogates Court in the county where she lived to check.  You may be able to force the house to be sold as a beneficiary. Let me know if you need further help.'}
