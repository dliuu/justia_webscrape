{'question': 'Does my boyfriend have a claim to a house deeded to me?I purchase a house fresh out of college.  It is deeded to me; my boyfriend co signed on the loan.  We broke up and I asked him to move out.  For 2 + year, he contributed $200.00 to monthly  expenses, while I paid the taxes, furniture etc.  He now wants 50,000 from me.  AM I wrong given the house is deeded to me? I reside in NY  I offered him 2,000 back for what he paid into the expenses for the 2+ years.  I have since refinance the mortgage taking his name of the obligations and can find no cause for him to think he is entitled to anything affiliated with the house', 'answer': 'Dear Home Owner: \n \nBased on your statement your ex has no legal claim to joint ownership of your house. New York State relies upon a recorded deed as evidence of an interest in the title to ownership of real property.  \n \nIt is fortunate for you that the ex voluntarily moved out.  \n \nOtherwise, even without any legal foundation to claim ownership or recoupment of money the eviction process would be long and frustrating, and at some point, as your legal fees pile up, you would jump to the conclusion that paying him off is the only method to get him out.'}
