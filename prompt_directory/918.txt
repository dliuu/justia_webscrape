{'question': 'I have a month to month lease in a commercial space. Can I leave with less than 30 days notice to landlord?I have a 6 month trial commercial lease. Started Dec1, 2022. With a three month guarantee and there after month to month basis. After June 2023, it would renew if no notice was given within 30 days from tenant to be a year lease. I would like to leave at the end of March 2023 today I would like to give landlord notice that I want to leave. All rent is paid up to date. Do I have to give a 30 day notice or can I just tell landlord in writing that I want to vacate before the next month April goes into effect without penalties? I can no longer work under the commercial lease because landlord is very volatile and confrontational. Need to be removed of this location asap.', 'answer': 'The terms seem a little unusual, but whatever you agreed will govern.  If the lease is month to month, no notice is required as a matter of law.  Just do not pay April, and leave by March 31.  However, if your document requires something different, that will govern.'}
