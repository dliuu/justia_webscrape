{'question': 'What can I do if my Mother, the landlord of a residence, used self help eviction tactics against me ? In NYS.My Mother abandoned the house and relocated. Stopped paying the mortgage as well. Bought herself a new condo. My family and I are living in the home currently. There&#039;s a forebearance on the house, which I haven&#039;t found out since October 2020. There&#039;s utilities that aren&#039;t working in the home. Need help finding a new place to live. Looking to countersue for pain and suffering, emotional distress. I had been seen by a therapist in July 2020.', 'answer': 'I&#039;m not sure you&#039;d be successful on the distress part.  However, depending on whether you&#039;ve been paying rent, you may be considered a tenant and can sue to have the utilities turned back on.  You need an attorney, now!'}
