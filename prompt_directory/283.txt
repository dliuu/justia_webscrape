{'question': 'renting my apartment since Feb 5, 2016 last night landlord sent his friend to my door to say I have to move out in 10dayFor the last 2 1/2 years I’ve had a leak in my roof that I brought to his attention and he told me he would fix it and kept putting it off and finally this past year it got worse and worse and when I started bringing it up to him more and more to fix it that’s when I started having issues with him. Every month I pay my rent and I’ve been having trouble getting my receipts from him and I’m constantly asking for them and I keep being told yes I’ll mail them to you yes I’ll mail them to you and now yesterday he sends his friend to my door to tell me I have 10 days to move out.', 'answer': 'Whether you honor the landlord&#039;s request that you move in 10 days is up to you.  However, if you choose not to honor the request, the landlord will have to serve you with a 90 day predicate notice that your lease, if any, will not be renewed or your tenancy will be terminated.  After that the landlord would be required to commence an eviction proceeding and obtain a judgment of possession before you can legally be evicted.'}
