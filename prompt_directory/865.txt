{'question': 'I recently got divorce. I want to transfer the ownership of the house to myself. My ex husband granted me the house.What I should do?', 'answer': '&quot;Granted me the house&quot; is not a legal phrase.  Is it in an order of the court?  Is it in a deed he already signed?  I am not sure where you are in the process to advise where to go.  Ultimately, you need to record a decree giving you the house, or a deed signed by your ex.'}
