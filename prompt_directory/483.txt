{'question': 'NYC Housing QuestionI am a medical resident with a large hospital in Brooklyn.  My program offers subsidized housing while working/studying.  I recently moved and the housing office says my security deposit will be returned I&#039;m 2-3 months. That doesn&#039;t seem right.   \n \nI thought NYC law required a security deposit to be returned within 2 weeks. \n \nAny help would be appreciated.', 'answer': 'Your correct... The Tenant Protection Act of 2019 requires security deposits be refunded within two weeks.  Unfortunately, the Courts are closed to non-essential matters.  As a result, if you wanted to commence a case, you will probably not have an opportunity to do so before the security deposit is refunded.'}
