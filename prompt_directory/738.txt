{'question': 'Can the Seller&#039;s agent decline to present the offer to the Seller&#039;s due to the Mortgage Co. that we&#039;ve chosen to use?My husband and I have been preapproved for a Mortgage through Quicken Loans. My realtor said that she refers all of her clients to a Banker that she knows because she and former clients have had bad luck with QuickenLoans. We asked her to put our offer in anyway b/c we had already done the leg/paperwork/approval with Quicken Loans. She put the offer in but left me a message stating that she discussed Quicken Loans with the Seller&#039;s agent and he was in agreement with her that we should use another bank. She also discussed with the Seller&#039;s agent that if the Seller doesn&#039;t accept our offer that we were thinking of increasing the offer by $5,000. Isn&#039;t this illegal? I feel like she showed the Seller&#039;s Agents our &quot;Cards&quot; before she put in our original offer and also put doubt in his head regarding the Loan provider that we&#039;ve chosen. Any advice?', 'answer': 'You have the right to complain to the local real estate board for which she is a listing agent.  I think she sounds rather unprofessional, and would consider her disclosure of personal information a breach of ethics.'}
