{'question': 'Being sued along with tenant for a dog attack. Am I responsible?I&#039;m a landlord in FL with a property in NY. The suit claims that my tenant&#039;s dog attacked a minor. It wasn&#039;t in the lease but we had verbally told the tenant that no pets are allowed. Am I still liable for the damages caused? What are our next steps?', 'answer': 'There is no way to determine from your post if you are actually liable.  However, it is important to appropriately respond to any litigation that has been commenced.  If you have insurance, the first thing to do is notify your insurance carrier and it may assign counsel to represent you.'}
