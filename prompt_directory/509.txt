{'question': 'My dad has land in P.R. and passed away in June 2018. How can I go about gathering or claiming information on that land?It is my understanding that my father and his siblings each purchased a piece of land in PR  at the same time more than 30 years ago.  \n My father was NOT married when he purchased  the property.   He then went on to marry my mom whom he divorced in 1990 before passing in June, 2018. \nUnfortunately during the death of a love, families tend to turn against one another and his siblings do not wish to share any information about the property in regards to location, size, cash value, etc. but are asking me to provide his death certificate, which I will Not provide to them.', 'answer': 'It would be better to post your question about how to find information about property ownership in a board for Puerto Rico where the property is locate.  If you intend to file to probate/administer your father&#039;s estate, the proper place to file will depend on where your father resided at the time of his passing.'}
