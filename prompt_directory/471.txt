{'question': 'New York State - when exactly are security deposits required to be placed in an interest bearing account?I currently own one 4-unit building  and plan to purchase additional properties in the near future, all in NY. From what I gather in the responses, the 6-unit law pertains to an individual building, not the total number of units a landlord owns, correct?  \nAlso, I read that if the deposit amount is $750 or greater it might be required to be placed in an interest-bearing account. Is that accurate?', 'answer': 'If the building has 6 or more residential units, they are required to keep the deposit in an interest bearing account. New York General Obligations Law Section 7-103.'}
