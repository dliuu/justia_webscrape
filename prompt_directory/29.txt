{'question': 'How soon can I take my landlord to small claims court to get my security deposit back . Itâ€™s been over 30 days .Also do they have to give back double for not having it back on time?', 'answer': 'Dear Rochester Tenant: \n \nAttorney Shay is correct that the new tenant security deposit statute requires the full return of the security deposit within 14 days after moving out. \n \nRead about your rights as a tenant in your city and the right to the refund of the tenant security deposit within 14 days after moving out at:  \n \nhttps://www.rochester.edu/reslife/assets/pdf/offcampushousing/tenants_rights.pdf \n \nAs pointed out by Mr. Luisi, a nicely composed letter may solve the problem and if not, then you invest a little money and some time suing the old landlord in Small Claims Court.'}
