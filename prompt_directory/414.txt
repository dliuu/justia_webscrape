{'question': 'Mother&#039;s will was in NC but she moved to NY 6 mos. ago. Assets are in mutual funds and bank account. Do I need a lawyer?I am named as executor. I am not on her bank account as joint owner but through power of attorney had access to her accounts.', 'answer': 'Did she pass away?  If not yet, you do not need a lawyer.  Make sure you are the beneficiary on all accounts.  If yes, and you are not the beneficiary, then as she died a NY resident, you probate the NC will in NY.  NY recognizes the NC document.'}
