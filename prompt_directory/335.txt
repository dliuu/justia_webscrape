{'question': 'Can my landlord keep my security deposit SOLELY because I ended my lease early. (All rent is paid)In NY. I moved out Sept 15th and paid rent for Oct. They have already rerented the apartment and I haven&#039;t been offered any return of Oct rent or the security deposit.', 'answer': 'If you are in New York, yes.  If you &quot;end a lease early&quot; that means you are breaking the lease.  Unless the landlord agrees to release you from your lease obligations, you remain responsible for the future rent payments for the balance of the lease regardless of whether you live there.'}
