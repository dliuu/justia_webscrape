{'question': 'I have trees  forming a very tall hedge in front of my house.  Code enforcement says it block my address number.If you are in front of the driveway opening it is visible looking from the street, but anywhere else you wouldn&#039;t be able to see the house numbers.  I want the privacy.  The trees are 10-20 ft tall.  Can the city make cut them down in height?  I&#039;m in Syracuse, NY.', 'answer': 'Dear Syracuse Home Owner: \n \nIt would help if you provided the section of the e-code with the violation cited by the inspector. There are many reasons to make a house number visible from the road before driving past the driveway, especially for emergency vehicles looking for your house in the dark.'}
