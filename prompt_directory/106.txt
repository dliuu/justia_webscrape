{'question': 'I rented an apt in Puerto Rico. The landlord assured me the place had been fumigated.He assured me it was fumigated because I pointed out there were two empty one gallon jugs present at the viewing. Over the first two months the bugs were so thick I would awaken at night with bugs covering me.  I stayed a total of ten days in two months complaining they needed to handle it.  Can I get my money back. Also the power was so bad I couldn&#039;t run an ac unit or cook in the kitchen without blowing breakers. A month later they finally replaced the whole panel and put in ceiling lights. Yes they were missing as well and still don&#039;t work.  The lights flicker in the kitchen to the point of darkness in the kitchen.  The power is so bad I can&#039;t poo popcorn in the microwave', 'answer': 'Since laws vary by jurisdiction and the apartment is in Puerto Rico, you will need to direct your question to a board with attorneys admitted to practice in Puerto Rico instead of New York.'}
