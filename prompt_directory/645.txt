{'question': 'I need a consumer protection lawyer in New York City.  I am dealing with a mortgage company .I had an offer for sale accepted at the end of August 2022, I paid 10% down and the loan officer stated that he would be able to help me with a loan. It was supposed to take place at the end of November 2022. The sponsor of the property, (seller) and the property management have been in touch with me but it only seems that they are getting the same run around from the loan officer. It is now mid-March 2023 and I was told to wait until the end of the month to have someone help me with the original loan.', 'answer': 'You do not need a consumer protection attorney; you need a real estate attorney because the fact that you&#039;re having direct contact with the seller makes me think you do not have an attorney representing you in your purchase.  If you DO have an attorney representing you in the purchase, that person should be helping you figure out the issues with your mortgage lender.  Do you have a mortgage contingency?  Assuming yes, did you meet or waive that contingency?  Your deposit (and may more money, depending on the contract) is at risk and you need to get off the internet and into an attorney&#039;s office as soon as possible.
