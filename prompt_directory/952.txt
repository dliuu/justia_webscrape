{'question': 'Landlord says I&#039;m not allowed on roof of apartment advertised as having &quot;private roof deck&quot;I recently signed a lease for an apartment that was advertised as having &quot;private roof deck&quot;. The posting went as far as including staged photos of said roof-deck furnished with patio furniture.  \n \nThe roof has only one entrance through a door inside the apartment.  \n \nThe landlord now claims we have no right to be on the roof.  \n \nThe lease makes no specific mention of the existence or absence of a roof. \n \nWhat can I do? I rented the place under the pretense that I am getting a roof, and I believe I was reasonable in coming to that impression based on the posting and communication with the realtor even in the absence of explicit mention in the lease.  \n \nWhat can I do?', 'answer': 'Landlord is breaching the contract. You have right to roof deck, even if it means taking him to court!'}
