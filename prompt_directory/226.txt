{'question': 'I&#039;m renting a house w/ lease stating &quot;Yearly lease has potential for renewal up to 3 years&quot; Can I stay if owner returns?I am renting a house with a 3 year possible commitment.  The lease states: &quot;Yearly lease has potential for renewal up to 3 years with the rate staying the same and after the first year the ability for tenants to give 30 days notice of vacating without penalty&quot;  If the owner decides to rent to someone else or move back into the house, do I have the legal right to continue to rent and pay the rental fee as agreed upon?  Thank you.', 'answer': 'Leases, like other contracts, cannot always be accurately reviewed by looking at just one sentence or clause.  Therefore, your best course of action to obtain an accurate answer to your question would be to forward the entire lease to an attorney and have it reviewed.'}
