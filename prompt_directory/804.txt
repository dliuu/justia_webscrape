{'question': 'My mother-widow, 80- owns her house. My siblings want to be on deed to avoid probate. Need help with forms RP5217, TP584My father died more than 10 years ago, and we wish to remove his name from the deed and avoid future probate by including our names on the deed. My mother will retain ownership of her house, but we&#039;d like to get our names on the deed. How would we define the &quot;condition of conveyence&quot; on form TP584 for these circumstances? Also, other than death certificate for my father and current deed, what documents do we need to submit? Lastly, I&#039;m a non-NYS resident, so what are my obligations for form TP-584? Thank you!', 'answer': 'I charge $500 plus the recording fees to do a deed.  It would take less time to do it than explain it.'}
