{'question': 'I moved into an apartment. Signed a one year lease 2/2020.  Since then I have lost my job due to covid closing.I now am out of money and falling behind on all my debit.  Can I get out of my lease?', 'answer': 'Generally, losing your employment or even the Covid crisis wouldnot constitute a legal basis to break your lease.  However, that doesn&#039;t prevent you from negotiating with your landlord to be released.  If you can present the situation in a way that  persuades your landlord he/she would be better off financially having you voluntarily leave by releasing you from your lease than spending money on legal fees and having you remain in possession for months after the August 20th moratorium on eviction ends before an eviction case can even be commenced.'}
