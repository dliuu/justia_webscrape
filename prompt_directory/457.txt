{'question': 'If I don’t pay the two months left of my NYC lease will my roommates credit scores be affected?I had to return back home to Ireland due to Covid - lost my job and didn’t have proper health insurance. My roommates are american and I don’t want to affect their credit if I can help it. When I told my landlord I’d struggle to pay May rent they ignored me and I haven’t heard from them. I used my deposit for Apri rent. I can’t apply for US or Irish unemployment so my options to pay are limited but I don’t  want to impact my roommates futures.', 'answer': 'When more than one individual signs a lease as a &quot;tenant&quot; they are each jointly and severally liable to the landlord for the payment of rent.  That means the landlord doesn&#039;t get involved in whatever agreement exists between the tenants as the the amount each intends to contribute to the rent.  Instead the landlord can go after one or all the tenants for the full amount of the rent provided for in the lease.'}
