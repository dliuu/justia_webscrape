{'question': 'My landlord is trying to evict me. He also bribed me with a total of $600 to leave the premis.Asked on August 19, 2020 in Landlord - Tenant for New York', 'answer': 'There is still a moratorium on Marshals actually conducting evictions but it does not prevent landlords from commencing cases to obtain judgments which can be executed on once the moratorium is over.  If you are behind in your rent, hopefully you applied and will receive assistance with any rent arrears through the NYC Rent Relief Program.   \n \nAs the the landlord&#039;s offer of $600, it is not uncommon for landlord&#039;s to offer to pay a small sum to help a tenant relocate and it is not generally described as a bribe.'}
