{'question': 'Property in NYC, there are 3 beneficiaries in the family, equal parts-myself, mother and brother. I am the executor ofThe estate, citizen in the US, my brother and mother have no permanent residency. My brother signed a contract with a real estate behind my back. Does that contract is even valid provided I’m the one with Letters of Administration issued by the Queens Court. Also, when completing possible sale, is my signature the only one required on the contract, or all 3 of us? \n \nTo clarify, there was no will leftover by my father, and the property ownership was then signed over to all 3 of our names by the court. The Letters of Administration were issued to me, as I understood it since I’m the only permanent resident in the US. Thus far I was asked to sign for any paperwork we had to deal with.  \nDoes it change things in terms of persons presents in the future sale? \n \nThank you \nThank you', 'answer': 'You mention being the Executor but then say you have Letters of Administration.  Executors are named in probate proceeding where Letters Testamentary are issue pursuant to a will and not in an administration where there is no will.  Best to consult with a local attorney in person to assure the information you are seeking is responsive to your actual circumstances and not a guess based off of contradictory infomation.'}
