{'question': 'what are the pros &amp; cons of doing a joint tenancy vs common tenancy house deed  (adding four kids to parents deed evenlyFour kids will inherit house after parents last away evenly (25% each ) we are updating the deed and was asked whether itâ€™d be joint v common tenancy', 'answer': 'Your question raises a number of important issues.  If the parents add the children to the deed with them as owners, each of the children would acquire a present interest in the property.  Assuming two parents and four children on the deed, each would be presumed to own 1/6 of the property unless otherwise specified.  In addition, judgments against any of the owners could become liens on the property and any one owner could file for partitition and potentially force a sale of the entire house. \n \nIf you have already considered those issues, the difference between tenants-in-common and joint tenants pertains to the right of survivorship.  For example, business partners typically own property as tenants-in-common and if one of the partner&#039;s pass away the deceased owner&#039;s share in the property is inherited by his or her heirs or beneficiaries.  In the case of joint tenants, the survivor(s) acquires the interest of a deceased joint tenant and nothing passes to the deceased owner&#039;s heirs or beneficiaries.'}
