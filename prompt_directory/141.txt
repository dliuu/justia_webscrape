{'question': 'we rented/own property from a shady dealer who promised that we&#039;d have foundation (there isn&#039;t). can we sue or get help?my mother who rented from our old landlord was promised that the three houses (trailers) would have foundation under all of them. when the ink was placed and the money spent we were stuck with 3 trailers that had no foundation, were not up to code, and now are slowly destroying themselves because of being on swampy land with shifting ground between seasons. my question is: is there anyway that we can sue the old landlord who sold us the houses so that we can place new houses (prefab or trailer) with actual foundation so that we can live safer knowing that the walls won&#039;t fall in eventually?', 'answer': 'In order to determine whether you have a potential cause of action against the seller, the contract that was signed will need to be reviewed.  I suggest scheduling a consultation with a local attorney to have the contract and the facts of your situation properly reviewed so that you can receive the appropriate guidance.'}
