{'question': 'Who declares a deed null and void? Is the property owner notified?  What happens to the property?Manlius, NY asked on December 18, 2022 in Real Estate Law for New York', 'answer': 'Do you mean the County Clerk refused to accept a Deed you filed after purchasing the property (or the Office of the Deeds Registrar)? If so, then the Deed may not have been prepared in the manner required by NY State Law to record a deed as a valid record of a transfer of real property. \n \nIf you paid for the property but the seller provided an irregular deed, if the seller will not cooperate with you there may be a need for a court order to compel specific performance.'}
