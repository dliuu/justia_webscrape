{'question': 'What are the consequences of an illegal basement apartment in Brooklyn?I&#039;m thinking of converting my cellar into a one bedroom &quot;apartment&quot;. It will have a full three fixture bathroom, a kitchen fixture, a door connecting to the outside and most likely a 3x2 window to the outside. I&#039;ll be adding a fire alarm and a monoxide detector as well for additional safety. \n \nWhat I&#039;m looking for are both consequences and the reality of it being forced. For example, from what I understand NYC DOB rarely enforces or gets a search warrant to inspect the area of interest (despite the inspectors taking the time to show up without a warrant). I&#039;m weighing pros and cons here. I understand the success of an illegal cellar is contingent on the complicity of the tenants, so I would be looking to rent to family friends who wouldn&#039;t give me any trouble. \n \nAdditionally, does having a basement apartment make a fire insurance policy void?', 'answer': 'Why not just make it legal and convert your home into a two family?  You are not correct about there being no inspections.  Also, you cannot enforce a lease of an illegal space.  It also will hinder any sale or refinancing.  Finally, it violates your insurance, and could lead to a lack of coverage.   In short, not a good idea.'}
