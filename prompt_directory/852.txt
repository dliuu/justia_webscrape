Evictions are stayed until further notice.  The landlord/tenant court is closed until further notice.  Your tenant knows this, and is taking advantage.  Hopefully, the lease is long enough that you will be able to sue later, if the tenant does not pay.  In truth, the tenant may have financial hardship and you should reach out and make a payment plan.'}
