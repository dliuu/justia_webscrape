{'question': 'I’m on a deed to a house along with my ex boyfriend.  The mortgage is in his name.  He’s filing for bankruptcy.What does it mean for me on the house? What will happen to the house?  Will I lose the house?', 'answer': 'The Deed is in your name so you own the home. Assuming the home is exempt there is nothing your liable for. If the home is not exempt the Trustee can take the home and sell it. Since your name is not on the mortgage it won’t impact your credit if your husband decides not to pay the mortgage.'}
