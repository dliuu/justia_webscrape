{'question': 'Is a real estate deed still valid if it was never recorded?Hi, \nMy father recently passed away. About 5 years ago my father told me that he recorded a new deed for his house. The new deed transferred ownership from him, to him and me, with joint tenancy with the right of survivorship. We found the original deed in his house, it was completed and notarized. We went to the Suffolk County Clerk&#039;s Office and found that the new deed had never been recorded. His sole ownership deed was the last deed recorded. There is no mention of the house in his will. \nI wanted to know if the joint tenancy deed was still valid and that it could it be recorded? \nThanks, \nVasily', 'answer': 'Yes it can be recorded and must be recorded to pass title.   However recording a deed post death could open up a challenge from other heirs if sny.'}
