{'question': 'I have a tenant who does not respect rules. They turn off my boiler while I have tenants upstairs. Can they be removed?Ive told them multiple times to stop turning off the boiler, they only have access to it because theres a bedroom on the other side of the boiler room they are renting. I noticed also 2 more additional people are living there.. because he added a mailbox with EIGHT names attached. Already violating the lease. Also they dont abide by recycling rules, I check the garbage and hear plastics. Ive told them they will be responsible for tickets. Anything I can do to enforce rules? even if its adding fees for inconvenience.', 'answer': 'Depending upon the status of the apartment and terms of any lease, you may be able to remove your tenant.  However, expect delays as a result of Covid.'}
