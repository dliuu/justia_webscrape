{'question': 'I loaned 20,000 to a family member for a housing flip. They still haven’t paid back. Can I charge interest?The contract never gave a direct date of when the project was to be done. But it’s been finished for over a year now and I still haven’t received the money. Can I charge interest even if it wasn’t specified on the contract that I would do so?', 'answer': 'Generally, the terms of a contract cannot be unilaterally changed.  However, you can certainly try to renegotiate the terms, especially since a family member is involved.  If this turns out to be a deal that has gone bad and your family member fails to pay you back, you may sue to recover the funds you loanded and you may be entitled to 9% prejudgment interest from the date it is determined the money was owed paid back to you.'}
