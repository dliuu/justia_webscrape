{'question': 'What are the consequences of an illegal basement apartment in Brooklyn?I&#039;m thinking of converting my cellar into a one bedroom &quot;apartment&quot;. It will have a full three fixture bathroom, a kitchen fixture, a door connecting to the outside and most likely a 3x2 window to the outside. I&#039;ll be adding a fire alarm and a monoxide detector as well for additional safety. \n \nWhat I&#039;m looking for are both consequences and the reality of it being forced. For example, from what I understand NYC DOB rarely enforces or gets a search warrant to inspect the area of interest (despite the inspectors taking the time to show up without a warrant). I&#039;m weighing pros and cons here. I understand the success of an illegal cellar is contingent on the complicity of the tenants, so I would be looking to rent to family friends who wouldn&#039;t give me any trouble. \n \nAdditionally, does having a basement apartment make a fire insurance policy void?', 'answer': 'From the phrasing of your question, it is obvious you know creating a basement apartment is problematic.  In over 30 years of handling L/T matters, I have met many clients that have elected to ignore the law and create illegal apartments.  Some get away with it for years before they get caught.  However, when a tenant, family member or neighbor, decides not to play along, things can get ugly quickly.  If, for example, you have a legal two family house and create a third &quot;illegal&quot; unit in the basement, attic or by subdividing one of the two legal units, you can be prevented from collecting rent from any tenants and face significant fines.  Also if a tenant is injured or there is a property damage claim, an owner can be surprised to learn his/her insurance won&#039;t cover it and can be subject to criminal charges in certain circumstances.'}
