{'question': 'Did Seller void a contract by not closing in time?My mother entered a contract to purchase a home. In the document she signed, it states very plainly that closing must be on or before September 22, 2023. My mother was told possession would occur at closing.  \nThe owner of the property was not ready to close on or before September 22nd, instead she decided to take a last minute vacation and we were told by our realtor the seller would require more time. My mother didn&#039;t approve of this. The seller did not close on or before 9/22 and my mother withdrew her offer four days later. On the next day after my mother withdrew the offer, the seller&#039;s lawyer states seller is &quot;ready willing and able to close,&quot; despite my mother withdrawing her offer already. The seller&#039;s lawyer filed Time of the essence despite the offer being removed and now claim they don&#039;t have to give back the &quot;Good faith&quot; deposit of $5K. My mother argues seller voided the contract when she didn&#039;t close in time. Who is in the right? My mother feels taken advantage of.', 'answer': 'I agree with Mr Smollens.  It appears from your question that time was not originally made of the essence in the contract (since you said the seller’s attorney “filed time of the essence”), and accordingly their not closing on the date may not have been a breach if you did not provide the proper notice to make it so.  \n \nAlso, once you are in contract the buyer can not simply “withdraw the offer,” because you have more than an offer, you have an accepted offer and a contract.  If she no longer wants to proceed with the sale, you can try to work something out to avoid losing the whole deposit, or maybe they breached in some other way that can act as an offset to use in negotiation.  Regardless as the seller has an attorney your mother should too, otherwise it can be an unfair playing field.'}
