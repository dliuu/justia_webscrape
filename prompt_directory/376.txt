{'question': 'How long should it take to transfer an inherited property from the trust of the deceased to that of the beneficiary?I&#039;ve inherited a rental property in NY through my deceased mother&#039;s (formerly) revocable living trust.  I live in another state and have been trying to get this completed through a recommended real estate lawyer in NYC, but it&#039;s been over a year since I retained her and not much more than a title search has been completed.  There are a few minor title issues to clear up and some written depositions for me to sign which I am still waiting for.  I know legal matters can take a while, so is this a typical timeframe to wait for a presumably busy attorney to prepare and file these documents?', 'answer': 'I am loath to reach a harsh judgment without hearing all sides to a story; therefore, I don&#039;t believe it is approriate to guess as to reasons for the delay in the situation you described.  Instead, I would encourage you to consider whether you still have confidence in the attorney you intially retained.  If not, which is certainly suggested by your need to make a post on this site, it may be time to retain counsel that you will have confence and trust in.'}
