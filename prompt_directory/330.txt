{'question': 'Can my landlord involve relatives in ongoing issue?As per our oral agreement, rent should be collected on every 1st of the month. Tenants will inform the landlord over the phone that the rent is ready.  \nHowever, this month my landlord did not answer his phone on the 1st so I called again on the 2nd he answered and was rude but he was informed that the rent was ready. a few days later he called our relatives and told them he went over to our apartment and we don&#039;t want to pay the rent.  \n1. Can he involve other people although it is a month to month lease? \n2. Is it right what he is doing? \n3. Can i sue him for that?', 'answer': 'So it sounds like your landlord just needs a letter written to him informing him of what he&#039;s doing wrong.  At the very least this will document everything.  Second, he will need to be informed not to contact your father.  You have to provide him official notice before you go on suing him.  You really don&#039;t have any damages and you haven&#039;t put him on official notice.  Suing him off the bat wouldn&#039;t produce much, except maybe an injunction (maybe).   \n \nI&#039;m happy to discuss this with you if you have more questions or need clarification on anything I&#039;ve said.  I&#039;m sure my learned collogues here will also weigh in.  In any event, I wish you nothing but the best.'}
