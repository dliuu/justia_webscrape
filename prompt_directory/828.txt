{'question': 'Florida foreclosure and property lien??Trying to make this simple... I live in NY a neighbor of mine needed a loan of 25k... And agreed if i give him the loan  it  would be as a mortgage  on 2 pieces of property he owns in FLA which we did the legal way recorded against the properties in FLA citrus county...This was in 2011 and on loan agreements was a balloon payment due a year later in 2012... Well my neighbor and friend fell on hard times and never repaid the loans and i was okay with it because they were liens on is property i thought i  was  protected.. Well fast forward to 2016 and my buddy dies we were like family  ....  Now goes thru probate his sister inherits all he has and now wants to  sell these properties but the liens come up so she calls me and asks me for releases for these loans because she believes he paid them which he never did...Now im told from a letter from her attorney because its over 5 yrs whether i was paid or not i abandoned my rite to payment under florida law... Is this the case??? Thanks', 'answer': 'Without further information regarding the legal contents of the note it is difficult to say whether New York or Florida law would apply.  There may be a choice of law provision in the note.  You should consult with an attorney in New York and Florida. \n \nIn New York, the statute of limitations for the collection of a debt is six years from the date the debt became due.  &quot;The statute of limitations in a mortgage foreclosure action begins to run from the due date for each unpaid installment, or from the time the mortgagee is entitled to demand full payment, or from the date the mortgage debt has been accelerated.&quot;  Plaia v Safonte, 45 AD3d 747, 748 (2d Dept 2007).'}
