{'question': 'I loaned 20,000 to a family member for a housing flip. They still haven’t paid back. Can I charge interest?The contract never gave a direct date of when the project was to be done. But it’s been finished for over a year now and I still haven’t received the money. Can I charge interest even if it wasn’t specified on the contract that I would do so?', 'answer': 'You can ask for prejudgment interest at the statutory rate of 9%.  You might get it.  Depends on what the contract says.'}
