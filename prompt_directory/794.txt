{'question': 'My property in Queens has been empty 4 yrs. I&#039;m paying my mortgage. But squatters moved in 12 days ago. What to do?I&#039;m having trouble finding honest property managers who are not looking for me to just give them card blanche to my property... take advantage of my situation. Is it time for a lawyer yet. I&#039;m afraid to go to the house Myself because the squatters were a major part of the reason I left my home to begin with. A bunch of unemployed mischievous neighbors who kept harassing me until I had to leave. I would like to hire a good property manager &amp; rent it. Do you make referrals to property managers or can someone review the contract I was given by a questionable property manager.... HELP!', 'answer': 'The squatter thing is a whole issue, since you cannot evict people now, and even squatters have rights as tenants.  You need to call the police and report it as a break in.  Waiting so long is an issue.  There are honest property managers, but in a small building that generates little income, it is hard for anyone to make money.'}
