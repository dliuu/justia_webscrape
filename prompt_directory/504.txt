{'question': 'Resident for 8 years, my deposit was $999 my landlord is now requesting an additional $941 for security, is that legal?I moved into my home 8 years ago, at that time my rent was $1495 and my security deposit was $999. My rent has been raised a few times over the years. My rent is currently $1775 and my landlord is raising it to $1940 (it will also included water and heat - new change) and also requesting that I pay an additional $941 towards my security deposit. Can they legally ask for that additional security deposit after I&#039;ve been here for over 8 years?', 'answer': 'Yes, when a lease is renewed, a landlord is entitled to ask for an increase in the security deposit being held.  The landlord is permitted to hold a maximum of one month&#039;s rent for security.'}
