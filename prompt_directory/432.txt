{'question': 'my current rent fee is now $2100 . 20+ years ago i paid deposit of $1100 so i wanted to use that as my last pay of rent.does my security deposit $1100 20 years ago could incur interest. Can i use it as my last month rent without paying difference from the $2100 rent now.', 'answer': 'The security deposit is used to compensate a landlord for possible damage to an apartment by a tenant and is not intended to be used for the last month&#039;s rent.  Landlord&#039;s are not generally required to keep security deposits in an interest bearing account.  If they due, a landlord is entitled to deduct a 1% administrative fee each year so with today&#039;s low interest rates a tenant could still receive nothing.'}
