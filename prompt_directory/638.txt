{'question': 'Does my boyfriend have a claim to a house deeded to me?I purchase a house fresh out of college.  It is deeded to me; my boyfriend co signed on the loan.  We broke up and I asked him to move out.  For 2 + year, he contributed $200.00 to monthly  expenses, while I paid the taxes, furniture etc.  He now wants 50,000 from me.  AM I wrong given the house is deeded to me? I reside in NY  I offered him 2,000 back for what he paid into the expenses for the 2+ years.  I have since refinance the mortgage taking his name of the obligations and can find no cause for him to think he is entitled to anything affiliated with the house', 'answer': 'I agree with attorney Nelson - absent a written agreement to the contrary, he has no rights or interest in the property if he is not on the deed.  Based on what you&#039;ve stated, his payment of $200 per month sounds like it would amount to less than rent would have been, so even if he were to sue you for &quot;improvements&quot; or &quot;unjust enrichment,&quot; he would not likely recover anything.   \n \nThe OTHER issue you may not have considered is that your boyfriend remains on the hook for your monthly payments.  From his perspective (to play Devil&#039;s Advocate), you need to remember that (1) if you miss any mortgage payments, the bank can always turn to him because he&#039;s obligated to pay just as you are for the length of the loan (28 more years?); and (2) If he wants to buy a home (or even a car), he&#039;s got a mortgage on his credit report that will probably prevent him from doing so.  Unless you are able and willing to refinance the house without him on the note, he has liability here, and there may be a value for him to accept that.  Maybe $50,000 is a fair payoff?  It&#039;s not for me to say.  You and he need to figure this out, and you probably each need a lawyer to negotiate and draft a buyout/settlement that contemplates all these possibilities (I think it would b a conflict for one attorney to represent both of you).
