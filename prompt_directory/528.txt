{'question': 'Can a landlord evict me for not opening the door for inspection?I received a eviction notice this week to leave by the 31st which is in 2 days. Btw I was at work.', 'answer': 'Unless there was a case already pending, any effective legal steps the landlord could take towards evicting a tenant take much longer than two (2) days.  Generally, tenants have an obligation to allow access to their apartments upon appropriate notice for the landlord to inspect and repair conditions within the apartment.'}
