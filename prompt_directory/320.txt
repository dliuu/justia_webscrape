{'question': 'Can a landlord or owner ask pre-screening questions before scheduling a tour of a unit? If so, what can they ask?When I call to set up a tour of an apartment, some people ask about my income, credit, number of people living with me etc. Seems unnecessary to have to answer these when I don&#039;t even know if I like the unit yet. What is the legality to them pre-screening on the phone?', 'answer': 'In NY, landlords can ask these questions lawfully. They cannot ask some personal questions such as religion, national origin, age, etc. They cannot ask if you are married and have kids, but they can legitimately ask you how many people will be living in the apt unit.  \n \nThese questions can sound very annoying and invasive, but landlords also have the frustration of taking time and showing a unit to those who cannot afford to pay rent at all.'}
