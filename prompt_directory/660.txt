{'question': 'What happens after you default mortgage 120 daysBrooklyn, NY asked on February 3, 2023 in Foreclosure and Real Estate Law for New York', 'answer': 'After your default for 120 days, your lender or the lender&#039;s servicer may elect to send you a default notice or a letter of acceleration. Accelerating the loan means that they are calling it as fully due and payable now instead of over the regular loan term. They may also send you a 90-day pre-foreclosure notice under RPAPL 1304 which is the New York law requiring that. After they send out the necessary notifications, they might file a summons and complaint with the Supreme Court for the county where the real estate is located and a lis pendens, or notice of pendency, with the county clerk which is public notice that there is a foreclosure action pending on the property. Foreclosure can take quite a long time in New York but you should take immediate steps to address this. You should hire an experience attorney to assist you with a loan modification, foreclosure defense, or if you simply wish to get rid of the property, you may be able to surrender or sell it. There are options to consider but these options can be lost and time barred if you delay.
