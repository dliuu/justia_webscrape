{'question': 'If you sign a real estate contract but tell your lawyer not to send it and they do, is that contract enforceable?My elderly father signed a contract that had no closing date. His lawyer did not tell him either. He signed the contract then instructed the lawyer to NOT send it to the buyer yet. He did so both verbally and through text. Is there any legal recourse? Is the contract valid if the lawyer went against the client&#039;s wishes?', 'answer': 'When an attorney acts on a client&#039;s behalf, they generally do so as an agent with apparent authority to bind the party for whom they are acting as an agent.  However, if the agent (lawyer) acted against your father&#039;s directions, your father may have a claim against the lawyer.'}
