{'question': 'What type of attorney specializes/handles mortgage loan modification fraud?Homeowner lost her job and couldnt pay mortgage for a few months. A servicer suggested that a mortgage modification is available if payments are made. The homeowner made the payments to the servicer, but the modification never occurred and now is at risk for foreclosure.', 'answer': 'I am not sure that there is a case here.  You owed the payments anyway and made them.  So, damages are an issue.  However, if a representation was made in writing and not honored, you can report to state banking department.  If it was oral, forget it.'}
