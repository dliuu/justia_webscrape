{'question': 'When brothers own a joint mortgage on a duplex and one can&#039;t continue to pay because they are going to a nursing home?we each live on our own sides I am concerned medicaid would some how intervene or would the other half go to the remaining joint owner.', 'answer': 'I agree with Mr Smollens.  Regarding the note and mortgage, you are each jointly and severally liable, which means that each bears legal responsibility on the whole amount. As well, the property itself is liable, which means that if the note is not paid, the lender may be able to foreclose upon  whatever portion of the property is encumbered by the mortgage. It would be wise to seek counsel now to explore your options in advance of any default on the mortgage.'}
