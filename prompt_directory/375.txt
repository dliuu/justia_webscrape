{'question': 'How long should it take to transfer an inherited property from the trust of the deceased to that of the beneficiary?I&#039;ve inherited a rental property in NY through my deceased mother&#039;s (formerly) revocable living trust.  I live in another state and have been trying to get this completed through a recommended real estate lawyer in NYC, but it&#039;s been over a year since I retained her and not much more than a title search has been completed.  There are a few minor title issues to clear up and some written depositions for me to sign which I am still waiting for.  I know legal matters can take a while, so is this a typical timeframe to wait for a presumably busy attorney to prepare and file these documents?', 'answer': 'No.  Something is amiss.  It should take a week.  I am not even sure why you are doing a title search, etc.'}
