{'question': 'renting question when owner is selling houseI rent an apartment in a house, no lease- month to month. the owner is selling house. She wants to send open house viewers into my apartment now and i am worried about covid. She said it would be second viewers only, but isn&#039;t following through with this. Is this fair? Do I have any rights? I have paid on time for 6 years. Plus how long do i have before she can legally make me leave? Many thanks. PS My landlady told me she was moving the same day the realtor put the sign up on the house.', 'answer': 'A landlord is not required to share information regarding plans to move from or sell the property they own.  Unless a tenant has a lease or is a rent regulated tenant, a landlord does not usually have to have a reason to ask a tenant to move.  When selling a house, landlord&#039;s are not required to deliver the premises vacant unless otherwise required by the contract of sale; however, interfering with an owner&#039;s ability to show the premises for sale is a great motivation to ask a tenant to move.'}
