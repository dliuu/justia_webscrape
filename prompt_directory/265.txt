{'question': 'I was living with my boyfriend in his house. He passed away in the end of September of 2020. His father has asked me toLeave but I have no where to go and have been looking for a place but my finances are very bad and COVID isnâ€™t helping me either as far as finding a place. He just left me a text saying he would be changing the locks in March 15 of 2021 and will restrict my entff egg y to the house. What can I do? Can he do this?', 'answer': 'Condolences on your loss.  As you may know there have been numerous moratoriums on evictions as a result of Covid pandemic.  However, even without the impacts of Covid, to legally evict a tenant or licensee, a judgment of eviction must first be obtained.  If you are concerned you may be illegally evicted, you should consider retaining counsel to put your late boyfriend&#039;s family on notice that you know your rights.'}
