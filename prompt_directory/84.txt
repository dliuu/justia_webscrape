{'question': 'I live across the street from a developer who used to play nice.  You knew what was going to be built 6 months inadvance, I checked the plans that often.  Then BOOM, they are bulldozing across the street and I get told one day “that is not an office building across the street they are building—it’s gonna be a hotel!” \nWAS ALL OF THAT LEGAL????? \nIt’s been a few years. \nDo Towns or Developers have to notify you that such a type of business has to notify you???  And the town is not enforcing planning board ideas to curb light and noise pollution which has severely decreased my property value.  I was here first and I feel my personal real property value has been destroyed.', 'answer': 'Your concern about neighboring development is understandable.  However, there is no way to provide a meaningful response to your inquiry based upon the information you have provided.'}
