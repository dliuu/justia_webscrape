{'question': 'Is it possible to back out of a lease for an apartment before you move in?I have recently signed a lease but have not moved in yet and Iâ€™ve been moved to part time at my job and will now not be able to afford it.', 'answer': 'Based upon your changed circumstances, the landlord may be willing to release you from your lease but is not obligated to.  It is likely that the landlord will try to retain any money you have already paid.  It may be to your advantage to retain an attorney to negotiation a surrender on your behalf.'}
