{'question': 'What happens in a seller stays past the date they were supposed to leave?We are in the process of closing on a house. The seller would like to stay 7 days past the closing and pay for it. With Covid 19 what happens if she refuses to move out after the 7 days? Could we get stuck with her as a tenant and not be paid for her stay?', 'answer': 'Greetings: \n \nWhat you are referring to is called &quot;post posession&quot;. This does NOT create a landlord/tenant relationship..whereby if the Seller stays beyond the 7 days...(their attorney should be holding money in escrow as an incentive for you to allow the post possession)..you will be paid a certain amount (to be reflected in the post posession agreement) each day beyond day 7..until the escrow monies are exhausted. At that point, you can change the locks and have their personal items discarded...as again..they are NOT Tenants at Law..and not afforded Tenant eviction rights/protection. \n \nSpeak with your attorney for details concerning your specific post posession arrangement.'}
