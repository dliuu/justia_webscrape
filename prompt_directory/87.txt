{'question': 'How to properly evict a tenant who has lived on my property 10 yearsI would like to evict my tenant because I don&#039;t not want to renew her lease and my daughter is having a baby and I want her to stay in the apartment I have downstairs. I own a 2 family home.', 'answer': 'In an ideal world you would speak with your tenant and things would move forward cooperatively.  However, that frequently does not work out.  Therefore, landlords are required to serve a 90 Day Notice of Termination on a long term tenant before commencing a holdover proceeding in Housing Court to recover possession from a tenant that does not voluntarily vacate.   \n \nIf you own the house in an individual and not a corporate capacity, you are not required to retain an attorney for this process.  However, moving forward without an attorney is definitely not a good idea as you are held to the same legal standard as those parties in Housing Court with attorneys and even a small mistake at an initial phase of a Housing Court case can result in the dismissal of the case months down the road.'}
