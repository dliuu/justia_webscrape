{'question': 'my brother owns a home, i am his only sister and relative does it automatically pass to me upon his passingshould i get documentation before he passes and how would that impact me in terms of taxes', 'answer': 'First, it would depend on the current ownership, whether he owns it alone or with someone else. A joint tenant would have rights of survivorship, which means they would take title upon his passing. Barring that, it would depend on whether he had a will upon passing, which would otherwise control the distribution of assets of his estate.'}
