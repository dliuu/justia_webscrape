{'question': 'What paperwork do I need to get drawn up?We want to purchase my brother&#039;s house he&#039;s willing to sell it to us at what he still owes its him his wife on it and his father inlaw as a co signer. We are building our credit currently and we don&#039;t have anyone to co sign for us. My brother said we can make monthly payments for the house. What kind of paperwork would I need drawn up and does all 3 of them need to sign it and does it need to be notarized also at the end of the agreement how do we go about switching the title to our name?', 'answer': 'As long as there is an institutional lender (for example, a Bank) with a mortgage, the new owners will need to qualify for their own loan to pay off the existing mortgage. A transfer by deed from the current owners to you without permission from the existing lender will initiate a mortgage default.'}
