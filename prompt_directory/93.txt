{'question': 'What do I do?I had given my tenant a non-renewal letter which I unfortunely did not know had to be 3 month prior to her lease end date. I let her know that I am willing for her to stay the extra 3 months that I did not give prior and she answered with &quot;Please contact my lawyer if you have questions for me?&quot; I am also leaving for a week long trip on Friday. What do I do in this situation? Do I get a lawyer, do I also let the tenant know that I will be away for that time? Tenant also stated that I am not renewing her lease due to her nationality, she is assuming that is why I am not renewing her lease. I just did not want to renew. The tenant also made changes that I did not agree upon.', 'answer': 'If the property is owned in your individual name, you are not required to retain counsel but would be foolish not to based upon the circumstances you have described.'}
