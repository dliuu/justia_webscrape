{'question': 'What type of door is required into my apartment from the corridor?I live in a two story, 6 unit building built in the 1920s and converted to the current number of units in early 1950s. The door to my apartment is self closing and swings into the corridor (not into my apartment). I discovered while changing the locks (apartment only came with a dead bolt and no lock on the doorknob) that the door is wood hollow core. It is extremely light and is terrible at sound blocking. When my next door neighbor leaves his apartment and talks in the hallway, it sounds like he is in my living room. I highly doubt that the door meets fire code, nor is it terribly secure - I’m sure someone could kick right through it if they felt the desire. As a woman who lives alone on the first floor, this makes me very uncomfortable. I’ve tried researching but can’t come up with any tangible ruling or code that would require my landlord to replace the door to one of higher quality.', 'answer': 'If describing your concerns and asking the landlord doesn&#039;t work, the surest way to get an answer to your question would be to file a complaint with HPD and request an inspection.  If the inspector find the  existing door to be a violation, the landlord will have a set amount of time to correct the violation or face a fine.'}
