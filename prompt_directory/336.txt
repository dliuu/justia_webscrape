My ceiling collapsed in my living room on 8-21-2020 due to neglect over the past 3 years. The ceiling has leaked each year since 2017 and all the maintenance did was plaster over the crack and then finally sealed the outside roof Oct 2019. The material that fell has tested positive for asbestos. The property manager and the regional manager say they aren&#039;t responsible for our personal items that got destroyed and covered with asbestos. Now the management are saying its gonna take 6-8weeks before we can go back there to live. Please help thank', 'answer': 'Call the Housing Department of the Buffalo City government.  This should be a violation and emergency repair.'}
