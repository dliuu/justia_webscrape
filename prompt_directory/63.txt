{'question': 'i live in NYS and would like some advise on how to evict my boyfriend from my home.BF is not on my mortgage.  we have one child in common who is 6.  he will not leave.  i have been given conflicting information on how to proceed so i would appreciate any guidance.', 'answer': 'I gather that the parent of your child is also not an Owner. I doubt that an eviction court would allow one parent to evict another parent. I suggest that you consult with a Family Law attorney.'}
