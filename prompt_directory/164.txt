{'question': 'How long can a &quot;guest&quot; stay in an apartment for and how many hours until it is considered a tenant?Ex; a roommates bf staying over every night, parking in the driveway, eating dinner and breakfast. Using the bathroom IE utilities, heat electric TV everyday for months. Should he be considered a tenant and start contributing towards the rent.', 'answer': 'Someone doesn&#039;t become a &quot;tenant&quot; based upon the number of hours they spend at an apartment.  A tenant is someone with a contractual relationship with a landlord to pay rent for the occupancy of the apartment.  It seems that what you are describing is simply a &quot;house guest&quot; who has been granted a license by another occupant of the apartment to be there.  Once this type of &quot;house guest&quot; has resided in an apartment for 30 days or more, they acquire the right to continue to stay.  Therefore, unless this type of &quot;house guest&quot; voluntarily vacates, he or she can remain in the apartment until a court order/judgment is issued requiring them to leave.'}
