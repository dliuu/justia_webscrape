{'question': 'My brother passed away in Puerto Rico. He left no will. He&#039;s not married and no children. Our father is still alive.I have power of attorney of my dad&#039;s real estate and financial situation. My mom is still married with my dad. Can we transfer deed to my dad? Can I do this with power of attorney.  Who would have rights to my brothers house after his passing?', 'answer': 'If the property is in Puerto Rico, you need a lawyer there.  If it is in New York, you need to become estate fiduciary in PR, and then do an ancillary proceeding here.'}
