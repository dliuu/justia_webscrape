{'question': 'For NYS Real Estate Law 226(c) must the tenant move as requested or can he fight this notice from the landlord?If 90 days notice applies must the tenant pay all future monthly rents to the landlord?', 'answer': 'Yes if the &quot;future monthly rents&quot; referenced here are the rent payable under the existing lease. If your landlord gives you the notice of termination or intent of no renewal in a legally sufficient manner, your current lease will terminate at the end of the lease. There is nothing to fight there.'}
