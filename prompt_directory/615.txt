{'question': 'Airbnb&#039;ing my spare room in my two-family home? NYCI own a two family home but use all of the home for myself. I would like to airbnb one of my spare rooms. Im located in NYC and have not applied with OSE yet. On the OSE application, it states to list the type of dwelling; there is a few option on the application,  should I listed it as a 2 family or i dont know/other.  \n \nI just want to fill out the application correct and avoid any issues.', 'answer': 'Dear Staten Island Home Owner: \n \nYou need a personal consultation with an attorney. Imagine the risk of an attorney telling you what to do when the attorney has not reviewed the Certificate of Occupancy, the HPD and DOB file for your property, and the records of the Department of Finance, and the attorney got it wrong, and you got in trouble and sued the attorney. Many fine real estate lawyers are based in Richmond County. Try calling one or more until you are comfortable with a client and attorney-relationship. Good Luck.'}
