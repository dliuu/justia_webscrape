{'question': 'Can a landlord come into the property if the tenant is under self quarantine? Also, how often?The landlords are selling the property and I am their tenant under quarantine. They are continuously having potential buyers and realtors in and out of my home.', 'answer': 'You should review your lease.  Most leases will provide that tenants are required to give access to the landlord, upon reasonable notice, to make repairs to inspect/show the property.  If your lease has these types of provisions, the landlord may seek to terminate your lease for failure to comply but that takes time.'}
