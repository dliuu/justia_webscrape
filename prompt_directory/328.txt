{'question': 'Can I file for a Letter of Administration for my mother&#039;s estate?My mother passed away. She was married at the time of her passing. Then her husband passed away. Now I am in the process of filing for the 9/11 fund for my mothers passing. Because she was married at the time of her passing, do I have to find her husband&#039;s heir&#039;s? I would like to file for a Letter of Administration for my mother&#039;s estate, not her husband&#039;s. Am I entitled to do this? If so, do I need to find my mother&#039;s husband&#039;s heir&#039;s before I proceed?', 'answer': 'You should still be able to file for Letters of Administration.  However, if your mother&#039;s husband was living at the time your mother passed, his estate will still be entitled to a share of your mother&#039;s estate.'}
