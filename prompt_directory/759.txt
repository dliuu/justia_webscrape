{'question': 'How can I fight to contest rpa871.My neighbor is requesting to have my fence remove from on my boundary line.I’ve lived at this property for over 10 years they recently purchased their property which is already fenced', 'answer': 'We need more factual background to better answer your question.  \n \nIf your fence height is less than the legal max and it&#039;s located on your property, then RPAPL § 871 won&#039;t help the new owner requesting for removal of your fence unless it&#039;s encroaching on his/her land.'}
