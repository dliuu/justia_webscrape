{'question': 'I’m a seller, we’re in contract (contingent on finding new home) however, due to the corona we can’t . Can we cancel?I’m a seller, we are selling our home and have been in contract for a few months. We did receive a down payment. The contract is contingent on finding another home, however we have not been successful and the Corona pandemic has halted the search. We want to pull out of the deal and return the down payment.  What can we do?', 'answer': 'If your contract has a contingency for finding a replacement property that should be enough to cancel provided you made a good faith effort to find the replacement property (what is considered a good faith effort is during a stay at home order is unknown). There maybe other clauses in the contract as well that permit you to exit or extend the contract such as force majure (an act of god). I recommend you read your contract thoroughly and hire an attorney if you don&#039;t already have one. Right now with the stay at home orders in effect in New York it is uncertain times and the answer will not always be clear. Best of luck.'}
