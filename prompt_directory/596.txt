{'question': 'Sublease agreement binding?Another party and I drafted a simple sublease agreement for commercial office space.  We reviewed all terms and made adjustments.  We signed the document and the other party is now wanting to amend terms after sharing it with their attorney.  Am I obligated?', 'answer': 'Since the sublease is signed by you and the tenant, that is a done deal. How you deal with the new demand is a business decision. Happy subtenant or unhappy subtenant? A subtenant who walks away? Your subtenant has an attorney. You should as well.'}
