{'question': 'I live in NY. A friend of mine has asked that I sign a lease agreement with her as a co-signer. Can I create a separatecontract between my friend and me, essentially saying that if she fails to pay her portion of rent and I am on the hook for the entire rent to the landlord, then my friend promises to indemnify me? Are these types of side contracts legal?', 'answer': 'there is nothing about making such an agreement and it should be enforceable. in court'}
