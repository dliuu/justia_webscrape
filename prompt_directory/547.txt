{'question': 'The spelling of my husband’s first name is different on his most recent driver’s license than on our mortgage documentsMy husband and I are very close to our closing date. His whole life, my husband has spelled his first name differently than the way it’s spelled on his birth certificate. It is spelled with a “G” on everything (taxes, expired passport, credit cards, utilities, diplomas, expired driver’s license, marriage license, etc) However, when he needed to renew his driver’s license, he was forced to use the name on his birth certificate.  He is in the process of legally changing his name, however his driver’s license still has his name with a “J”. All of the documents connected to the purchase of our home have his name with a “G”. What should we do?', 'answer': 'Whatever the bank wants once you disclose this information.'}
