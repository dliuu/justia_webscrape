{'question': 'Hi \nI have a some one move out 2.5month ago  \nBut he leave some things behind  \nWhat can I doBrooklyn, NY asked on April 23, 2020 in Landlord - Tenant for New York', 'answer': 'Since the courts are essentially closed in response to the COVID19 crisis you will not be able to seek relief from them at this time.  Therefore, the most efficient thing would be to communicate with the person who moved out to obtain permission to remove the belongings to be disposed of or placed in storage.  If you do so without permission, you run a risk of being accused of an illegal lockout during the COVID crisis which might not be viewed favorably.'}
