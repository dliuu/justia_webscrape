{'question': 'I live in Waterford, NY and our lease is about up and don&#039;t auto renew. Can he make us leave?The reason it don&#039;t auto-renew is that he emailed me stating that he was not renewing it about 2 months ago. It was a 90 day notice via email. Not in writing. He want&#039;s to move in our apartment on September 1st and we can&#039;t find a like place around here. My wife is on unemployment and I am on Worker&#039;s Compensation. Most places want proof of income. Our rent is current.', 'answer': 'Unless you are protected by a lease or rent regulation, a landlord does not have to renew your lease.  However, if you do not voluntarily surrender possession, the landlord must start a court case and obtain a judgment before you can be evicted.  If you are current on your rent payments, the Court has the discretion to give you up to 1 year to find an apartment to move to . As a result, very few people actually face being evicted by a Marshal or Sheriff'}
