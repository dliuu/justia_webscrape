{'question': 'I live in NY State. I have a question regarding the legality of a letter/document.My wife and I own a home together in Orange County NY. Many years back, my wife under duress wrote a letter stating that upon the sale of our home, her mother would receive 1/3 of the profit from said sale. Is this letter legal. It was written as an email and only signed by my wife. The document was not signed by myself or by my mother-in-law, nor was it ever notarized.', 'answer': 'Maybe as a contract between your wife and her mother, but not as a lien on property or any restriction on the sale.  If you do not pay the mother, she could in theory sue under the contract, which seems to be likely unenforceable.'}
