{'question': 'How long does a lawyer have to release funds held in escrow from a previous estate once asked for themBy sisters estate adminstration ?', 'answer': 'Unless the attorney is the executor or administrator there would be little reason for the attorney to be holding money in escrow , except possibly in connection with the sale of real property.  In any event, provided the terms of an escrow agreement mandate the release of funds, it is simply the matter of the escrow agent/lawyer writing a check.'}
