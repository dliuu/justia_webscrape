{'question': 'I need a consumer protection lawyer in New York City.  I am dealing with a mortgage company .I had an offer for sale accepted at the end of August 2022, I paid 10% down and the loan officer stated that he would be able to help me with a loan. It was supposed to take place at the end of November 2022. The sponsor of the property, (seller) and the property management have been in touch with me but it only seems that they are getting the same run around from the loan officer. It is now mid-March 2023 and I was told to wait until the end of the month to have someone help me with the original loan.', 'answer': 'If you&#039;re seeking an attorney, you could supplement your own searches with the tab above, Find a Lawyer.
