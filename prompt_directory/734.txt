{'question': 'If my father passed away and just his name on the deed are me and my brother entitled to the house if step mom sells it?My father passed away and left everything to my step mom thinking she would help my brother and I but she totally ignores us and is planning on giving everything to her children. I&#039;ve recently been contacted by a lawyer asking my to sign a paper so she can sell the brownstone in brooklyn I refused and she can&#039;t sell it. My father stated in the will he leaves all property to her but her name is not on the deed am I entitled to the property if she passes away or do I have any rights to a portion of the money if I sign the paper and they sell the house. The house is worth about $1,000,000. I don&#039;t understand why the lawyer needs my signature if I have no right to it. Any explanation of this would be helpful.', 'answer': 'If there is a will, and you are not a beneficiary, you are out of luck.  It is legal to disinherit kids.  If there is no will, then you and your brother get half.  If there is a will, you might be being asked to sign a waiver to probate it.  You can refuse, but the will will be probated unless you have some basis to object.'}
