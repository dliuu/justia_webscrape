{'question': '(NYC) Am I able to leave my NYCHA apartment?I am the lease holder of a NYCHA apartment in the Bronx. I would like to surrender the apartment and leave however I have a guest that has been there for more than 30 days and does not want to leave due to no evictions at this time. Can I still surrender the apartment? What happens if I surrender, move out and heâ€™s still there? Will NYCHA continue to charge me? Any advice is appreciated', 'answer': 'Generally, a tenant must deliver vacant possession of the premises to the landlord before being relieved of his or her obligations.  However, it may be possible to negotiate on your own or with the assistance of an attorney for the release from your obligations in exchange for your cooperation with steps to obtain removal of the occupant.'}
