I have it on video tape that the end gave a testimony to She said that she always had this paperwork in her safe at the bank but my sister-in-law ripped it up', 'answer': 'A power of attorney may allow a person to sell real estate why the person is alive.  If someone promises to split a house once they die that falls under probate and a power of attorney has no effect. \n \nIf the power of attorney specifically stated proceeds were to be split there may be grounds to file suit.  You should consult a lawyer in the jurisdiction where this happened.'}
