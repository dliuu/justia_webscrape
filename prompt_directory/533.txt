House is whort  now 650 K \nI continues to pay for everything and she is still a co-owner. \nNow my question is: is there anything that can be done about this? What can I do? How much more do I have pay to her? And does she still have the right to a half of the house if she&#039;s not paying anything for it?  \nSomebody can help me ?', 'answer': 'This is a common situation that can be resolved through negotiations or, if a settlement cannot be reached, through litigation by bringing a partition action and asking for an accounting as part of the case.  Technically, the court can order a sale of the property but not a buyout of one party by the other; however, most of these cases are resolved prior to sale with one party buying out the other&#039;s interest.'}
