{'question': 'i live in NYS and would like some advise on how to evict my boyfriend from my home.BF is not on my mortgage.  we have one child in common who is 6.  he will not leave.  i have been given conflicting information on how to proceed so i would appreciate any guidance.', 'answer': 'Generally, to evict someone that you have a &quot;family&quot; relationship with, you would need to commence an ejectment case in Supreme Court.  Although as an individual you are not required to have an attorney, I would strongly encourage you to retain local counsel to assist you.'}
