{'question': 'What made you become a lawyer? What do you wish you knew at my age (15)? How do I become a lawyer? Any pros and Cons?I am doing an interview for a summer program and would like true answers if possible.', 'answer': 'You are very young now, but it is good that you set your goals so early. When you get to college, concentrate on keeping good grades and when you get to that point, you could look into an exam called the LSAT. For now, you can read about the profession and try to learn as much as you can. Learn about the different areas of law out there. Speak with attorneys. If you can volunteer or work in paid internships at law offices, you could learn from that too. Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
