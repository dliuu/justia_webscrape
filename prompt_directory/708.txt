{'question': 'Can I force refinance of mortgage, without divorce decree?Divorced, haven’t lived in home for 4 years. Ex promised she would refinance, she hasn’t and won’t, mortgage company states that an assumption of mortgage cannot be done. There is no divorce decree, everything was settled privately, I took her at her word that she’d refinance . I want my name off the home, what are my options if any?', 'answer': 'You have no options.  Should have done a divorce decree.  You can sue for partition to force a sale, and get the mortgage paid off.'}
