{'question': 'Do I have a case to get refunded for my Airbnb?I was trapped in the building in NYC due to a busted lock on the only exit and had to call 911 to pry me out. Airbnb doesnâ€™t want to refund me the cost of the stay. They want me to return to that building. Do I have a case to get refunded?', 'answer': 'Most short-term rentals in NYC such as those offered through Airbnb are not legal.  If you are agrieved by how Airbnb is handling your request for reimbursement, you may consider commencing a Small Claims case.  However, Airbnb typically includes an arbitration requirement.  Therefore, you should carefully review your contract before commencing any litigation to avoid having it dismissed.'}
