{'question': 'I own a house. My s.o. moved in a few months ago but we are now breaking up. How long should I give for her to move out?I initiated the breakup. \n \nWe do not have a formal lease, but before she moved in we had verbally agreed that she would pay a fairly small amount monthly when she started living here (she did not ever start paying). \n \nThe house is in my name only, with a mortgage (don&#039;t know if this is relevant). \n \nI would like to understand both my legal obligations, and what would be fair/reasonable accommodations.', 'answer': 'My office handles these issues all the time.  You have several options but Iâ€™d need to know more facts.  Contact an attorney to review your options.'}
