{'question': 'Can your ex sue for half the profit of a sold property after she signed the deed over?Property was stated to be sold by a specific date in the decree. Didn&#039;t happen. A year and 4 months after the date passed, she signed the deed over to me through a warranty deed. Now is threatening to go to supreme court.', 'answer': 'It depends on the agreement of the divorce or the court order.  If she was entitled to a share of the sale, regardless of the deed being signed, unless there was a subsequent agreement in writing, or court order, then that is what is owed.'}
