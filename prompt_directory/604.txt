{'question': 'Can a NY HOA change their by laws themselves or is a lawyer required?Our original condo Offering is missing 2 pages - which detail duties of Officers of the HOA.  None of the owners, managing agent, local realtors attorneys used in closings have these missing two pages.  We want to simplify the process by developing our own by-laws,.  We want to do so without the need for a lawyer', 'answer': 'Dear Clifton Park Condo Owner: \n \nI suggest you research NY model forms of Condominium Bylaws. I doubt anyone will suggest that it is agood idea to do an amendment of Bylaws without an attorney since this may require the approval of the Attorney General.'}
