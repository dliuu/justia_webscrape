{'question': 'Landlord files a lawsuit in 2017. Never sent me any notice and its 2020. How can i get this cleared from my record?In 2016 I lived with roommates and moved out the following year. I did not renew my lease and one roommate ended up staying. I  returned my keys to the landlord and even wrote a nortarized letter stating i will not be returning, as per their request. Fast forward to 2020 i learn that they had filed a lawsuit against me. I dont understand why or how since i returned my keys and never signed renewal lease with them. They never even sent me summons so i never knew! The lawsuit was filed in 2017. I call their offices to find out and my name is still on the lease! \n  \nWhat steps can i take to protect myself?', 'answer': 'If there is an existing judgment, and you never knew about the case, and you have a return of keys defense, you can move to vacate the judgment.  I charge $800 for this motion if it is in Civil Court in NYC.'}
