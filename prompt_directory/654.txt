{'question': 'Hi, I&#039;ve put my apartment on Airbnb and curious how I should split the profit with my boyfriend.I got the apartment(lease) by my self and lived there for a year by myself, I put down deposit, I paid a guarantor fee every month, decorated and bought all the furniture, I am doing all the daily maintenance of the Airbnb account and finding cleaner, photograper etc. My boyfriend moved in a year ago and have paid half the rent since. I don&#039;t have a TIN or SSN so I need him to do the Airbnb. How should we split the profit? \n \nI am paying a high monthly fee and 2k when moving in to have a guarantor which let me get the lease by myself without SSN.  \nThe reason to split it at all is cause I want to be fair to him, he has paid 50% rent for the last few months and we need his SSN/tin to post the Airbnb. Everything else is on and thanks to me.', 'answer': 'Determining how to split the profit from your Airbnb listing can be a complex issue that may depend on a number of factors, including the financial contributions of each party, the level of effort and involvement required, and any other agreements or arrangements you have in place. \n \nBased on the information you provided, it sounds like you have made significant financial and practical contributions to the Airbnb listing, including paying for the deposit, guarantor fee, and furnishings, as well as managing the account and coordinating with cleaners and photographers. Your boyfriend has contributed by paying half of the rent and providing his SSN/TIN to post the Airbnb listing. \n \nOne possible way to split the profit fairly could be to divide it based on the proportion of financial contributions each party has made. For example, you could calculate the total cost of the deposit, furnishings, and other expenses related to the Airbnb listing, and determine what percentage of those costs you have covered versus what percentage your boyfriend has covered. You could then split the profit from the Airbnb listing in the same proportions. \n \nAnother approach could be to divide the profit based on the level of effort and involvement required for each party. For example, you could keep track of the time you spend managing the account and coordinating with cleaners and photographers, and compare that to the time your boyfriend spends communicating with guests and managing the rental while guests are there. You could then split the profit based on the level of effort and involvement required. \n \nUltimately, the best way to determine how to split the profit may be to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your respective contributions and expectations. You may want to consult with a financial advisor or accountant who has experience with rental income to help you determine a fair split.'}
