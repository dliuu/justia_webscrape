{'question': 'I moved in with my girlfriend and her mother who are both on the lease . Her mother is trying to kick me out ?I have lived here for over 7 years and receive mail and public assistance in the same address', 'answer': 'Even if you aren&#039;t on the lease, your girl friend and her mother have to take you to court in order to evict you.
