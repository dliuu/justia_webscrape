{'question': 'I inherited a corporation that has invested large amounts of money in a property which is now for sale by the estate.as 100% owner of the corporation now can i file an unjust enrichment claim to recoup some of the investment on behalf of the corporation?  I tried to purchase this property however i am the executor and my family will not approve of the sale even though I offered over fair market value for it.  I also ran a sole proprietorship out of the same property and have money invested in the property.  I paid rent to my parents who owned the property as well as the corporation that is now mine.  I need advice how to proceed.  Do I have any legal basis to recoup investments made by me or the corporation?  Does this provide any leverage against my family refusing to agree to sell the property to me.  I am being very careful to fulfill my fiduciary duties while also trying to be certain I am not giving away what would be rightfully mine if the the property is sold to a third party.  which I do not want to happen.', 'answer': 'You have presented a complicated situation that is not suited to being addressed in this forum.
