{'question': 'Home I just purchased came with two sheds, contract and RPR include them.  Paperwork found for rent-to-own shed.I just purchased a home with clear inclusion of two sheds on the RPR and the Contract.  Upon moving in, paperwork was found in a cabinet in a pile left by the owner disclosing that one of the sheds is a rent to own with around 20 payments left.  I have already loaded the shed with my personal belongings and am concerned it will be repossessed with my belongings inside.  What can I do?', 'answer': 'This is something that an experienced real estate attorney should advise on, but your post remains open for three weeks. If you did not already have an attorney representing you in the matter, you could consider reaching out to one and ask them to review the contract and/or provisions for handling of payments on that second shed. Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
