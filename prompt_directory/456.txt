{'question': 'If I don’t pay the two months left of my NYC lease will my roommates credit scores be affected?I had to return back home to Ireland due to Covid - lost my job and didn’t have proper health insurance. My roommates are american and I don’t want to affect their credit if I can help it. When I told my landlord I’d struggle to pay May rent they ignored me and I haven’t heard from them. I used my deposit for Apri rent. I can’t apply for US or Irish unemployment so my options to pay are limited but I don’t  want to impact my roommates futures.', 'answer': 'If they are not on the lease then nothing will happen.  If they are on the lease, they need to pay.'}
