House is whort  now 650 K \nI continues to pay for everything and she is still a co-owner. \nNow my question is: is there anything that can be done about this? What can I do? How much more do I have pay to her? And does she still have the right to a half of the house if she&#039;s not paying anything for it?  \nSomebody can help me ?', 'answer': 'She has a right to half the house, but you are entitled to credits for what you paid.  If you cannot get her to sign a deed to you for her half, you have to bring a partition case.'}
