{'question': 'Can the executor of my aunt&#039;s estate come after me for the joint account my aunt put me on years before she passed away?my brother, one of the beneficiaries of the will, left me a threatening message saying I&#039;m suppose to pay all the expenses from that and that I robbed him!', 'answer': 'Short answer -- if she pays the filing fee she can come after you.  The question is will she win.  This is a more complex question, and depends on many factors, including the reason you are on the account.  If it was &quot;convenience&quot;, i.e. to help pay bills, etc., then you could have to give it back.'}
