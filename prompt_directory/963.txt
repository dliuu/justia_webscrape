{'question': 'Are signed papers for purchase of a pre foreclosed house I inherited that are missing particulars filled in legal.I inherited my father&#039;s house, it&#039;s on pre foreclosure. I just wanted to get rid of it ASAP. Signed papers with a company that said some information in the papers would be filled in later because not all information was obtainable at that time. A month later nothing has been done. Am I legally bound to these papers if information is incomplete. I trusted this person to get everything done quickly but now I&#039;m doubting the whole decision. I know nothing about foreclosures or selling a house. I&#039;m on disability so I couldn&#039;t afford to get legal help. I was told the short sale would take 3-5 months but a month after signing papers nothing has happened. I don&#039;t know what to do. Thanks for any advice.', 'answer': 'You were likely scammed.  Call the DA and see if they will do anything.  Undoing what was done would cost more than things might be worth unless you get help from law enforcement.  While I would need to see the papers to know for sure, you probably gave title away, and the papers represent you were paid for it.'}
