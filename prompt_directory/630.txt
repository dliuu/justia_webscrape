{'question': 'I guess the question is, how in any way could a contract, lease, agreement, etc. be enforceable if it wasn&#039;t signed?Charlotte, NC asked on March 30, 2023 in Contracts, Real Estate Law, Land Use & Zoning and Landlord - Tenant for New York', 'answer': 'Contracts generally do not need to be in writing to be enforceable.  Certain types of contracts do, such as those for the sale of real property or leases for periods of more than year.  But unless excepted from the “statute of frauds” which requires certain agreements to be memorialized in writing, verbal agreements are just as enforceable as written ones—sometimes the issue becomes one of “proof,” since terms in writing can be easier to prove than those spoken.'}
