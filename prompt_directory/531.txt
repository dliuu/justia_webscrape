{'question': 'Can I legally break lease if roommate violated lease?I signed a lease with a roommate for one year starting Jan 2020. It is now 20 days in, and I am planning on moving out and not paying rent(which in turn does break lease) but the reason being is because roommate is violating the lease by subletting to her boyfriend and I do not feel comfortable. Can I be sued since she technically broke the lease first?', 'answer': 'since I have not reviewed you actual lease, I cannot provide an answer for your specific situation. Generally, roommates are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of rent to their landlord and a roommate that leaves before the expiration of a lease remains liable to the liable to the landlord for the full amount of the rent.'}
