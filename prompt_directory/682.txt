{'question': 'I have accidentally signed two leases, I did not know I was signing the leases when I did it.I haven&#039;t moved into the place, the leases are for 2023-2024.', 'answer': 'It would be helpful to have more information about the leases and the facts surrounding them.  For example, how was it that you did you not know you were signing a lease if you in fact signed it?  The facts surrounding the signing and whether a contract was formed may also be relevant.  Was there some form of fraud or coercion?  Was whatever you signed countersigned?  It is a pretty factually-heavy scenario so having an attorney review would likely be productive.'}
