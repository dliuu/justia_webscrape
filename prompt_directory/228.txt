{'question': 'Landlord is trying to get my wife to reapply for her rent-stabilized apartment instead of renewal.My wife is a co-tenant in a rent-stabilized apartment. The other tenant moved out and severed contact with us. When we informed them, the management company told us that we had to reapply for the apartment instead of offering a renewal. Shouldn&#039;t my wife automatically be offered a renewal as a current tenant?', 'answer': 'When adding or deleting co-tenants to a rent stabilized lease, the landlord is generally permitted to issue a new lease instead of a renewal lease.  However, this does not automatically mean that the landlord has the option to decline issuing the new lease to an existing tenant.'}
