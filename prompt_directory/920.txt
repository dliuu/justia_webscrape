{'question': 'My friend has a reverse mortgage on her home and we want to setup a lease to own agreement for myself. Is she allowed?She has around 600k on the reverse mortgage and she will still live in the house but I will pay her rent monthly on this lease to own contract so that I can buy it from her after three years.', 'answer': 'Do not do this.  It will be a catastrophic mistake.   If you want the house that bad, then borrow the money to pay off her mortgage, and get a deed encumbered by your own mortgage.'}
