{'question': 'My Mom was sick and I was sole heir to her estate upon her death I switched the will to my sons name with an agreementI needed to have no assets at time because of health ins issues My wife had cancer and I lost my job So being power of attorney for her I switched the will to him with a verbal agreement that it would be split up later Also two other sons. Since then he put his girlfriend on the deed to secure a small investment she made to the property Now they want to keep it all He admits he screwed up snd I should have made a contract but is there anything I can do to claim a part of the estate She is fighting it not him', 'answer': 'You may want to repost this with Probate and Estate Planning added as categories - you are mentioning a will, being an heir, and an estate. There&#039;s no guarantee that every post is picked up, but you might have better chances of a response in those sections. Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
