{'question': 'Does an existing Notice to Vacate transfer to a new property owner or do they have to issue an updated one to me?I&#039;m renting a house that was sold.  The new owners issued a Notice to Vacate so that they could renovate and flip the house.  After finding out, within a month, the cost to renovate, they are selling it.  Is the 30-Day Notice they issued valid when the new owner becomes my landlord for the time being or does the new owner have to issue me their own Notice to Vacate.  This is not a non-payment of rent issue.  This is solely to do with the new owners wanting possession of the house I&#039;m renting.  I&#039;m not opposed to leaving.  I&#039;m just trying to buy myself as much time as possible to secure alternate housing.  Any help is appreciated!', 'answer': 'Generally, a new owner steps into the shoes of the previous owner with respect to tenancy issues.  However, as a result of the Covid crisis there is a moratorium on evictions until at least August 20th so you should have ample time.'}
