{'question': 'What happens if you buy or sell a property and the bathroom count is different than what is listed?Say there are supposed to be 1.5 bathrooms but instead there are 2?  What will happen when the bank appraises it for a mortgage?', 'answer': 'In my view, the issue is not what the bank thinks, but whether there is a Certificate of Occupancy or other governmental approval for the bathroom &quot;improvement.&quot;  You should check with the building department of the local municipality to be sure that there are sufficient C/Os for the improvements made to this 1/2 bath. \n \nGood luck!'}
