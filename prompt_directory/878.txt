{'question': 'Can I file a quit claim on property in Puerto Rico with out going to Puerto Rico?Delmar, NY asked on February 8, 2020 in Real Estate Law for New York', 'answer': 'You might want to repost this under Puerto Rico, as it appears to be something that a real estate attorney who practices in that jurisdiction would be most familiar with. You&#039;ll see Puerto Rico when you click &quot;more states,&quot; below Washington, DC, in the third column. Good luck \n \nTim Akpinar'}
