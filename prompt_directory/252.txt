{'question': 'What legal/financial right does my sibling have to a home that belongs to my sister and IOur mom was the original owner of the house and a year before she died, she turned over ownership of the house to my sister and I. Now one of my sibling is demanding we sell the house so he can get his share of the property. My sister and I have live at the property with our mom since the purchase and still reside there. Our mom also did not have a Will drafted.', 'answer': 'If your mother did not own an interest in the house at the time of her passing, there is no interest in the house for your sibling to inherit.  If your sibling believes your mother was not competent to transfer her interest in the house to you or it was done improperly, he may commence litigation to set aside the previous transfer to you.'}
