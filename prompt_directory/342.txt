{'question': 'Our lease has expired and it says it is now month to month. We agreed via text to stay 1 year but want to leave. Can we?We did not sign a new lease. It says specifically in our lease that once it expires we would be on a month to month contract. We agreed to stay for one year via text but now want to leave with 30 days written notice. Is the text a legal document even if the lease says itâ€™s month to month?', 'answer': 'It&#039;s possible that you entered into a binding contract through your text messages.  However, it is also possible the landlord won&#039;t pursue you for breaching that contract if you provide adequate notice and especially if you find another tenant that is ready willing and able to take over the apartment.'}
