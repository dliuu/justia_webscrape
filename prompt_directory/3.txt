{'question': 'Question:  Can a landlord raise rents (for unregulated unit) for Major Capital Improvement Costs and pass onto TenantThis is for an Apartment in a 3-family property so all Apartments are unregulated.  Tenants moved in recently, there is no signed lease (with BOTH parties having signed).  Tenants signed, but the Landlord has not signed.  So Tenants claim there is an oral lease in place.  However, I believe there are mechanisms for raising rents for Major Capitol Improvements that may be necessary, even if there is supposedly an oral lease in place. Landlord claims there is no lease because it was not ratified or signed by both parties.  Landlord believes Tenants are in Month to Month Tenancy, which is fine, but Landlord will have to raise rents starting in November 1 due to Major Capital Improvements costs.  Even if there was an &quot;oral lease&quot; in place, there is a law that allows Major Capitol Improvement Costs to passed onto Tenants, no?', 'answer': 'Rent increases for Major Capital Improvements (&quot;MCIs&quot;) relate only to rent regulated properties.  In unregulated properties, landlords are not required to justify the reason for a rent increase.   If a tenant has a lease for a specific term, the rent cannot generally be increased until the lease expires unless the terms of the lease provide a specific exception allowing the landlord to do so.  In non rent-regulated apartments, Landlords are required to provide written notice to tenants if they intend to raise rent by five percent or more. The landlord must provide such notice at least: 30 days in advance of renewal if a tenant has lived in the apartment less than one year and has less than a 12-month lease.'}
