{'question': 'Hello from New York. My dad recently died, my mom died a year earlier, the house is still in my dad&#039;s and mom&#039;s name.I live in the house. Dad and Mom wanted only me to have house, not my brother, because I took care of them for over 10 years. There are no papers signed though for me to have it. My brother said you have to have his name on it also because they left no papers for me to have it. \n \nIs this true? I don&#039;t want to split house. \n \nWhat if my brother doesn&#039;t want his half? It still has to be in his name also? If so, can he then just give his half to me if he wants to with a title transfer?', 'answer': 'Your brother is right.  Children split equally if there is no will.'}
