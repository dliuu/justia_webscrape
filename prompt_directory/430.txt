{'question': 'my grandparents who are now both deceased the house is foreclosed. auction no one brought. can I call the bank?the house went up for auction twice but didn&#039;t sell. can I call the bank and attempt to get the mortgage reinstated ?', 'answer': 'If you qualify for a mortgage, you can buy the house like any other person.   It&#039;s not clear from your question whether the auction was after a Judgment of Foreclosure.  You might want to do some investigation into the status of the foreclosure.   The bottom line is that the foreclosing bank will not &quot;reinstate&quot; mortgages that were given to your grandparents.'}
