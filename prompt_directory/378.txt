{'question': 'My father signed me over a property quit claim, he has a heloc on it but won’t pay. Is there anything I can do?He has Alzheimer’s and his wife took over all finances. I live on the property but I feel like she will let it forclose just to spite me. Is there anything that I can do?', 'answer': 'You need to pay.  Also, the quitclaim deed was not the best.  Probably should consult an elder/estate planning lawyer to see where you stand.'}
