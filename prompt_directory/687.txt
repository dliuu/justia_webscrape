{'question': 'How to review a NJ property contract?Hi-- \n \nMy wife and I are reviewing a contract to buy property in NJ and we would like to retain the services of an attorney as soon as possible in order to handle the attorney review. We&#039;d like to sign the contract today so we&#039;d at least to retain somebody since we would have 3 days once both buyer (us) and seller sign to start the attorney review.', 'answer': 'This is bread and butter work.  You are posting on the NY board.  I am admitted in NJ and NY.  However, if you just call a local lawyer near the property (which you can find on this site or Google), it would be fine.  Do not sweat it.  Once you hire the lawyer, attorney review can be extended by consent.'}
