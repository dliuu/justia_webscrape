{'question': 'My sister bought me out of my share of our parents house with a personal mortgage to me before she passed away.Her children refuse to honor a mortgage debt of 70,000 to me.  What can I do? The mortgage was recorded.', 'answer': 'Send an acceleration notice and then immediately begin foreclosing on it.  It&#039;s a big task to do a foreclosure proceeding, so you&#039;ll probably need the assistance of an attorney and all in you&#039;ll spend $10K or so by the end.'}
