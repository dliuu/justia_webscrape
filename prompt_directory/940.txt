{'question': 'If a deed/ mortgage has the husband, wife and wife’s daughter before marriage listed on deed. Is it survivorshipThe deed reads the husbands name and wife’s name and wife’s daughters name as the owners. What does ux mean in terms of wife’s ownership. The Deed doesn’t have ux in it. I was asking because I ran in to the term. On the deed/ mortgage itself says John Doe and Jane doe and Mary doe.', 'answer': '&quot;UX&quot; is an old style abbreviation in Latin for &quot;husband and wife&quot;.  I would need to see the deed, but it sounds like it is 50% the parents, and 50% the daughter.  The parents have survivorship rights between them, but as to the daughter it is tenants in common.'}
