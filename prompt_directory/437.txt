{'question': 'Hi, what happen if I break the commercial lease due to slow business due corona ?can landlord go after me( my personnel asset ex: bank account .... )  if I break the lease again due to the slow business cause of corona', 'answer': 'As we sit here, the NYC law was changed to nullify personal guarantees.  Thus, the landlord cannot do so.  However, there are constitutional and jurisdictional issues that make this law suspect, so it is unclear now what will happen.  If you want to break your lease, now is the time to do so, as you have the greatest leverage.'}
