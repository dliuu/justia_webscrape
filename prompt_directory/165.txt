She has called the police twice for imagined incidents. The last incident a few days ago, she called the cops claiming I threw keys at her daughter. I wasn’t even home. I was at work. Boyfriend did not let cops in. Woman became irate, claimed we were FBI agents. Ended with her being taken to hospital. When I got home her sister warned me her sister “had army behind her”. Also 6 cop cars were dispatched. I feel harassed and unsafe. Spoke to management, they don’t want to terminate lease.', 'answer': 'Unfortunately, both you and your landlord are in a tough place.  The landlord cannot simply evict your neighbor because she may suffer from mental health issues as this would be a prohibited type of discrimination.  However, if your neighbor&#039;s conduct endangers other tenants, the landlord may have an obligation to move forward with efforts to try to evict your neighbor through a holdover proceeding.  However, with the backup of cases resulting from Covid, the matter will take many months to work through the courts even if your landlord acted immediately.'}
