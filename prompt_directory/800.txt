So my question is are they entitled to anything? Its 3 of them', 'answer': 'These cases turn on the facts.  You must answer it and not default.  The fact the deeds were done by a lawyer and notarized helps, as long as those people will testify for you.  However, you are years away from that issue.  For now, you just need to respond.  The manner of the response depends on whether you are in Surrogate&#039;s Court or Supreme Court, which is unclear from your post.'}
