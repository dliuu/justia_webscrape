{'question': 'My landlord is Evicting me I wrote a letter stating I would be out on this date but I can’t move out nowDo I still have to move out on that day or dose that peice of paper we wrote and signed mean nothing because it wasn’t notarize and I haven’t been evicted yet', 'answer': 'Whether or not the agreement you made was notarized is not what protects you in this instance.  Instead, Gov. Cuomo&#039;s moratorium on evictions in connection with the COVID-19 crisis provides you with protections.  See Executive Order 202.28.  In addition,  the landlord still needs a judgment of possession before acting to legally evict you.'}
