{'question': 'Can I Airbnb my owned apartment for more than 31 days in NYC?I&#039;m the owner of a residential apartment in New York City in a 45-unit condo and I want to know if our rules are in conflict with owner&#039;s rights to sublet. &quot;GUEST POLICY Under the New York State multiple dwelling law, a residential multiple dwelling can only be used for what is termed “permanent resident purposes.” New York state law makes it illegal to sublet apartments for less than 30 days. It is a violation of these Condominium Rules and Regulations to rent a unit for less than twelve months. \na) Guests are permitted only if owner is not receiving any consideration or payment for the guest remaining in the unit. \nb) Owners should be vigilant and notify management and the Board if they witness any unauthorized guests. \nThese rules, as all others, exist to allow all owners to have safe and peaceful occupancy of their homes within the building community.&quot; \nalso, these rules seem to be in violation of privacy if i have to disclose my guests, or whether they help me pay morgage', 'answer': 'Coops/Condo may adopt more restrictive residency rules than NYC'}
