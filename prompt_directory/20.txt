AND found asbestos which I was disturbing doing laundry! Took last months rent from us as well to move in.', 'answer': 'Depending on when a building was constructed or modified, a certificate of occupancy may not be required.  Testing is usually required to verify the presense of asbestos.  If a security deposit was required, the landlord is not permitted to also collect last month&#039;s rent.'}
