{'question': 'a neighbor asked to help and now he is trying to hurt me I don&#039;t know what to doHi we needed some construction work in our property and our neighbor saw us and he volunteered to help us at no cost as a friendly neighbor gesture. I accepted and thought that he was really going to help. So i told him what i wanted done and left the property and then kept on asking for progress from him but never really got results just told me we did this and that and then he asked for a huge sum of money and then i went to my home to see nothing really done after a full month. Only minor things were done so i asked for where the work is and i asked for receipts of the contractors. after asking for receipts he got angry and started telling me i am not trustworthy and sending me daily messages and how he would bring his lawyer and more. All i asked for was receipts because he also did things that i told him i don&#039;t want done. but he is very rude and not accepting to send them and today he threatened us that he is going to put a lean on our home if we don&#039;t pay in cash or certified ch', 'answer': 'If you never signed anything, you are likely OK.  Anyone can sue anyone if they pay the fee.  The question is can they win.  Here, it seems not likely.  Take photos of the alleged work or lack of work so you have evidence to show the court if you need to.  If he puts a mechanic&#039;s lien on the property, which you will get notice of, call a lawyer.'}
