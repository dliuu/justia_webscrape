{'question': 'How long does a judgement against investment property last after the debt is no longer reported to credit agencies?I have a judgement against property from 2008. The debt has stopped being claimed on my credit. I want to sell the property but can&#039;t if there&#039;s a lein on it. What can I do about it, I don&#039;t understand the public record documents well enough to find my own answer.', 'answer': 'Judgments remain a lien on real property for 10 years from the date of entry unless extended by court order.  If your judgment was entered in 2008, it is likely not still a lien.'}
