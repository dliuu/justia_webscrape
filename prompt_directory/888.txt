{'question': 'How do I get an “occupant” (per lease agreement)  to move out of my apartment?My ex-girlfriend is an “occupant” on my apartment lease (via a lease rider). She refuses to move out now that we have broken up. Can I give her a written notice period to get her to move out after a certain number of days? If not, is there another process to get her out of the apartment?', 'answer': 'You need to get a court order to evict her.  Or, let your landlord do it.'}
