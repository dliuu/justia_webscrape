{'question': 'Do I need lawyer assistance in completing a &quot;Tenancy deed with right of survivorship&quot; to add my wife to the deed?I own the home and want to add my wife to the deed. Do we need the assistance of a lawyer to have a &quot;joint tenancy of survivorship&quot;  done legally? We are completing the forms and I know it needs to be notarized but does it need lawyer approval?', 'answer': 'You do not have to have a lawyer, but as there is no such thing as a &quot;tenancy deed with right of survivorship&quot; and you are confusing the type of deed with the nature of the tenancy in the deed, it sounds like a lawyer, for a few hundred bucks, would be a good idea.'}
