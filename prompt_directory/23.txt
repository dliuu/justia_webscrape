{'question': 'As a home owner do I have to pay for broken damaged appliances caused by my tenant?I am a home owner and when my tenant moved in, all appliances including ceiling fan was in excellent working safe condition. Last summer I had to replace the ceiling fan because he was being too rough with it that the wires got disconnected. Now the oven door frame is broke (looks like it was ranked off the screws). He is very rough in the way he handles things. I need to know if he breaks these items due to his negligence, do I have to pay for repairs/replacement?', 'answer': 'Tenants are generally responsible for damage caused by misuse of the rented premises/  However, the items you mentioned as needing repair could merely be the result of regular wear and tear for which the tenant is not responsible.'}
