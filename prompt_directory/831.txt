{'question': 'Selling sister&#039;s condo, profit of $65K, she is a missionary in Peru how can she avoid taxes until return in few years?Hi. My sister has been a missionary in Peru for four years, and plans to do this for several more years.  I am in the process of helping her sell her Condo in NYC.  She will have a net equity profit of approximately $65,000 at sale, she does want to use this to buy her next home when she returns from her mission.  She is 56 years old and will probably settle down in Florida when she finishes her missionary work.  Is there a way she can postpone the tax hit on the $65,000, without directly purchasing another home within the year of selling of her condo in NYC?  Thank you!', 'answer': 'It is possible that she qualifies for exclusion of capital gain on that sale. It sounds like she could avoid all of the estimated $65K in gain under Tax Code Section 121(c), as long as she sells before she is out of the home for about 4.5 years. The opportunity is much more challenged after that. However, there is possibly another opportunity for her to take a full exclusion of all gain, applying IRC Subsections 121(c) and 121(d)(12), because her work is much like that of the Peace Corps, which also has a special exception. \n \nI would consider planning a sales based upon the assumption that the tax can be excluded, if the timing of the sale meets the exceptions mentioned above.  \n \nYou might find additional answers on our FAQ page, at:  \nhttps://www.stopirsproblem.com/frequently-asked-questions/'}
