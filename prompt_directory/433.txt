{'question': 'been a tenant for 20+ years in my apt in queens ny. I wanted to use my security deposit $20+ years ago of $1100Been renting more 20 yrs in my apt in woodside NY, (queens) and did alot of renovations and never bothered my landlord for anything. Before pandemic my landlord told me she needed her apt back to use she gave me 1 month notice. I told them i will look for an apt but till then i will continue paying my now $2100 rent.  \nNow i got my apt and ready to move out and i wanted to use my security deposit of $1100 , 20+ years ago as my last rent payment . \n But my landlord threaten to sue me if i dont replenish it with another $1000.  \nWhat are my rights as a good paying Tenant for 20+ years  \nAre there anything i can get paid ,for all the renovation and updates i did. \n And do i get anything back for being a Tenant for 20 years and have been paying on time .', 'answer': 'If you are moving at the end of the month, the Landlord has no means to enforce the demand for an additional security deposit before you move.  Unless a tenant has an explicit agreement with a Landlord to provide reimbursement for renovations, a Landlord is not obligated to reimburse a tenant and can actually seek to recover damages from a tenant if the alterations were unauthorized.  By being a longterm tenant and paying rent on time, you fulfilled your legal obligations and apparently had a home you enjoyed.'}
