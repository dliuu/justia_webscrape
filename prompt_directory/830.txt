{'question': 'Selling sister&#039;s condo, profit of $65K, she is a missionary in Peru how can she avoid taxes until return in few years?Hi. My sister has been a missionary in Peru for four years, and plans to do this for several more years.  I am in the process of helping her sell her Condo in NYC.  She will have a net equity profit of approximately $65,000 at sale, she does want to use this to buy her next home when she returns from her mission.  She is 56 years old and will probably settle down in Florida when she finishes her missionary work.  Is there a way she can postpone the tax hit on the $65,000, without directly purchasing another home within the year of selling of her condo in NYC?  Thank you!', 'answer': 'If the property has been her primary residence and she has not changed residency then the property would qualify for the personal residence exemption and the first $250k in gain would be exempt.  \n \nThere needs to be an analysis of her residency status. Just because she&#039;s out of the country doesn&#039;t mean she has changed residency. It&#039;s hard to make that determination with limited facts and those facts should not be discussed on a forum.  \n \nAlso, it appears that you&#039;re referring to a 1031 exchange in the later part of your question. A 1031 has much stricter time limits than the same year and is no longer available for non-business property under the TCJA. If you wanted to consider a 1031 you&#039;d have to convert to a rental first and exchange for a new rental property. There would need to be a conversion back to personal use at some point which may create a taxable event and is risky in the event of an audit.  \n \nI would hire a professional. There&#039;s enough here to justify the cost.  \n \nBest of luck.'}
