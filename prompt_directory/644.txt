{'question': 'I need a consumer protection lawyer in New York City.  I am dealing with a mortgage company .I had an offer for sale accepted at the end of August 2022, I paid 10% down and the loan officer stated that he would be able to help me with a loan. It was supposed to take place at the end of November 2022. The sponsor of the property, (seller) and the property management have been in touch with me but it only seems that they are getting the same run around from the loan officer. It is now mid-March 2023 and I was told to wait until the end of the month to have someone help me with the original loan.', 'answer': 'Real estate transactions in New York typically have attorneys on both sides (and one for the bank, and for co-ops, one for the co-op itself).  You should contact an attorney to review the contract of sale (or if not yet entered into, to review the seller&#039;s draft) and deal with any issues related to the mortgage financing.  The contract will spell out your rights and obligations with regard to financing (assuming there is a financing provision).'}
