{'question': 'Is a rental agreement and utility bill enough to be granted entry into canada from the US?h', 'answer': 'Entry into Canada requires that all persons carry both proof of citizenship and proof of identity. A valid U.S. passport, passport card, or NEXUS card satisfies these requirements for U.S. citizens.  However, US citizens can no longer cross the border, back into the US, from Canada, using only a driver&#039;s license and birth certificate.  \n \nIn addition, there are new travel restrictions because of Covid-19.  These restrictions may change frequently but have included the following: \n \nLand Border: \n \nEffective February 15, 2021, travelers arriving to Canada by land will be required to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test result taken in the United States within 72 hours of arrival.  This requirement extends to Canadian right of entry populations.   \nEssential travelers (truckers, nurses, power crews, members of cross-border communities) will not be required to provide a negative test. \nEffective February 22, 2021, travelers entering Canada by land will also be required to take a COVID-19 test on arrival and at the end of their 14-day quarantine period.   \nView additional information on these requirements at this website. \n Air Travel:  \n \nIn addition to providing a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of arrival, as of February 22, 2021, air travelers will be required to take a COVID-19 molecular test when they arrive in Canada before exiting the airport, and another toward the end of their 14-day quarantine period.  \nAs part of this new policy, travelers will be required to reserve a 3-night stay in a government-authorized hotel prior to their departure to Canada.  Travelers will be required to stay at their reserved hotel for up to 3 nights, at their own cost, while they await the results of their arrival test.  Those who test positive must finish their 14-day quarantine in a Canadian government-designated facility.  \nView additional information on these requirements at this website. \nMandatory Use of ArriveCAN App: \n \nEffective February 22, 2021, all travelers arriving by land will be required to submit their travel and contact information, including a quarantine plan, electronically via ArriveCAN before crossing the border.  All travelers arriving to Canada must also continue to electronically submit daily COVID-related information throughout their quarantine period.  Use of ArriveCan by air travelers remains mandatory. \nRules and procedures can change quickly.
