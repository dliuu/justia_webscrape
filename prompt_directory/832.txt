{'question': 'Selling sister&#039;s condo, profit of $65K, she is a missionary in Peru how can she avoid taxes until return in few years?Hi. My sister has been a missionary in Peru for four years, and plans to do this for several more years.  I am in the process of helping her sell her Condo in NYC.  She will have a net equity profit of approximately $65,000 at sale, she does want to use this to buy her next home when she returns from her mission.  She is 56 years old and will probably settle down in Florida when she finishes her missionary work.  Is there a way she can postpone the tax hit on the $65,000, without directly purchasing another home within the year of selling of her condo in NYC?  Thank you!', 'answer': 'Yes, but this should be done with the lawyer hired for the transaction.'}
