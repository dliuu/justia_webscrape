{'question': 'I am on section 8 and my landlord wants to do renovationsI am on section 8 and my landlord wants to do renovations in the whole house without a permit and I think there is asbestos in the walls. Can I stop him until I get it checked out, or do I need to go to court to force him to stop?', 'answer': 'If your landlord begins renovations and does not have proper permits, you can call 311 to be referred to proper DOB office to report work without permits.  If an inspector finds work is being done without the proper permits, a Stop Work Order can be issued.'}
