{'question': 'Landlord agreed I could sublet without restrictions, but now is trying to reject a sublet (with no explanation).The original lease said no subletting without prior landlord approval, but it&#039;s a 2 bedroom apartment and I was signing the lease alone (with the intention of subletting the second room) so we agreed via email to amend that term to &quot;There will be no restriction or extra fees on subletting, provided tenant sends a copy of the sublease agreement and a copy of the Photo ID of any potential subletters prior to them taking occupancy&quot;.  No issues with my first subletter, but they moved out and I&#039;m leaving the city for the holidays so I found someone who signed a 5-month sublease and is paying most of the rent in exchange for use of my room when I&#039;m not there. Based on the amended terms, I figured it would be fine &amp; sent it &amp; ID to landlord before Nov 1. Now the subletter is already partially moved in and they&#039;re trying to say they don&#039;t approve and I need to cancel my lease and he needs to sign a new lease directly with them if he wants to live here (even though I plan to move back).', 'answer': 'If you intend to have a roommate occupy part of the apartment while you still live there, that is not a sublet.  \n The sole tenant on a written lease in NYC has the right to have a roommate witout any prior approval from the landlord.  Only if you vacate the apartment while you have someone else live there is it considered a sublet.   \n \nIf you are subletting instead of having a roommate join you in the apartment, the provisions of your lease control what you are allowed to do.  A landlord does not have the ability to unilaterially change the terms.'}
