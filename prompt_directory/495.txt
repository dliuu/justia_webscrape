{'question': 'My landlords make noise constantly throughout the day and night, is there any league ways I can get them to stop?They are constantly slamming all doors including cabinets and so on. They also constantly yell while being in the same room as each other, to the point that it’s almost as if I’m in the same room as them. This also includes verbal fights. The most recent of which was at 12:15am. I’ve lived here for over a year and have asked them to please keep the noise down and they have not done that whatsoever. I have not been able to get a full night sleep in over a year and have to constantly be on edge due to the fights that are constantly happening. I cannot afford a lawyer due the COVID -19 issues going on in the world right now. I just am looking for any advice from a legal standpoint right now. Thank you if you’ve read through this', 'answer': 'As the courts are closed to all but essential business because of the COVID19 health crisis, there is probably not much hope a having this issue addressed by the courts in the near future.  Practically speaking, the type of problem you are describing is difficult to address even without a health crisis and when another tenant instead of the owner is creating the noise.  It may be more cost effective to find another apartment that does not have a noise issue.'}
