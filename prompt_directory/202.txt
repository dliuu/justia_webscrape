{'question': 'In a Multi family building shouldnâ€™t the tenants be informed if other tenants have bedbugs?Had asked the building Manager about bedbugs that were reported in the building but she said that she cannot disclose any information to the other tenants about the issue but we literally live right next to these people and I feel as if we should have been informed because it can cause an infestation', 'answer': 'While it is certainly understandable that you would be concerned about bedbugs in your building the applicable disclosure laws vary in New York State depending upon where you live.  For example, NYC has a disclosure requirement (see:  https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/bedbugs-information-for-homeowners-and-tenants.page).  However, not every city, town or village in New York State has similar disclosure requirements.  Therefore, you should consult with a local attorney or Department of Buildings for the laws applicable where you reside.'}
