{'question': 'can my landlord evict me if my lease is up Nov 1 and I stay even after I tell them I&#039;m not resigning?I live in NYC, my lease is up Nov 1.  my roommate left due to COVID and I can&#039;t afford it on my own. I have to tell them by tomorrow if I&#039;m resigning or not. Cuomo just extended the no eviction law until Jan 1. do I fall under that category?  I have paid in full all through covid and have been a great tenant, they&#039;ve lowered my monthly rent from 3100 to 2700 - but I still can&#039;t do that on my own.', 'answer': 'It is likely that it would take the landlord until after January 1st to evict you.  However, that will not absolve you of liability for the rent and possibly legal fees.'}
