{'question': 'Renting in jamaica queens apartments Please help with my notice for not renewing my lease without cause?I am been asked to find new apartments and given 3 month notice stating my lease will not be renewed. I do not know the reason why they are saying so and we are finding it hard to find new house to buy or rent in this market. I have baby with special needs and i do not know what to do. I want to extend the lease or atleast go month to month. But i do not want to get evicted. Can you help', 'answer': 'The landlord is not required to renew or extend a lease or state a reason for seeking to terminate a non-regulated tenancy.  However, if you do not vacate by the date specified in the Non-Renewal Notice, the landlord must obtain a judgment of possession through the courts before you can be evicted.  With the assistance of counsel, many tenants are successful in negotiating favorable terms to vacate.'}
