{'question': 'Will eviction warrants be allowed to process for holdover cases on June 20th in NYC ?Brooklyn, NY asked on June 8, 2020 in Landlord - Tenant for New York', 'answer': 'Pursuant to Executive Order 202.28, the moratorium of evictions was extended through August 19, 2020.  \n Since the language references  &quot;initiation of a proceeding or enforecment of either an eviction of any residential or commercial tenant for nonpayment of rent&quot; you can make the argument that the extension of the moratorium  only applies to nonpayment cases.   \n \nRealistically, however, do not expect movement on any eviction related matters (nonpayment or holdover) until the Housing Court opens again for non-essential matters.'}
