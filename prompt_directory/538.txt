{'question': 'My mom passed in the blizzard of 2010.  No will.  House was paid.  Sister lives there still. I&#039;m the oldestAfter 5 years we would sell the house and split the monies.  This sister is a lot shady.  Can my brother and I force her to sell?  I believe she has a felony  \nConviction and we never appointed her executrix.  If we did we never received papers for it what would be our recourse.  She has tried to withdraw whatever Money my mom had in the bank with her girlfriend but was stopped by the bank manager.  Just to give a little insight as to her demeanor.  Mom also received a settlement from a fall which we never saw dime from for $27,000 . I&#039;m sure my mom also had a safe deposit box and Lord only knows what else she is hiding .  My brother and could sure use a little help right now.', 'answer': 'If an estate has not already been created, you may file a petition in Surrogate&#039;s Court to be appointed Administrator.  In that role you could compel a sale of the house and take additional action.  There is no requirement that you hire an attorney but most people find it extremely helpful.'}
