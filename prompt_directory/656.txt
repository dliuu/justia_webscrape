{'question': 'Amending mortgage loan terms from same lender who is a family member.I have a mortgage loan from a family member effective Jan 2020.  A mortgage deed was recorded (NY) and refers to the respective promissory note. The lender (family member) and I want to amend to adjust the interest rate and term - the interest rate will be adjusted as of Jan 2020.  Does the mortgage deed also need to be amended (and if so, recorded again)?   \n \nNot concerned here with gift or income tax implications.  More concerned with the ability to rely on the amended terms in the event another party were to succeed to the rights of the lender (e.g., through death, bankruptcy, etc.).  Thanks!', 'answer': 'There&#039;s no such thing as a &quot;mortgage deed&quot;.  Have a free consultation with counsel.  \n \nJack'}
