{'question': 'What are the laws regarding webcams and &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot;. A neighbor wants my nature cam moved.I live on a lake and have a webcam in my window that shows my yard and the lake. It also shows mine and my neighbors dock. The docks extend out to the water from the two lots. Cam can be viewed on my website 24/7. My neighbors have asked me to move the camera when they are home on the weekends  because they do not want to be seen on their dock. I understand their privacy concern, but If I move the camera to the left, a massive tree interferes with the view of the lake. They have been here for 2 years and the cam has been there for 6 years. Many people use the camera and rely on it including the local sailing/rowing clubs, fishermen, and residents. The local ABC station uses the camera on their weather segments. Do I legally have to move this camera? You cannot tell who is who on the camera, you can just tell that there are people out on the dock. The camera is not directed toward their windows or their yard. It simply points out my guest bedroom window and the shows the entire lake.', 'answer': 'Are you publishing the footage?
