{'question': 'My grandparents died and the house is still under their name, I need to put the house in my mother&#039;s name.I also have to change the electric and water to her name and was told I needed an Affidavit.', 'answer': 'The answer will depend on whether someone, in addition to your grandparents are on the Deed and if so what type of ownership. \n \nCertain facts must be known before it can determined if the house can be put in your mother&#039;s name. Not an exhaustive list of questions: Did your grandparents leave Wills; what do the Wills say about who gets the assets; does your mother have siblings or nieces/nephews from predeceased siblings; is there a mortgage or reverse mortgage on the house; was the house owned by your grandparents alone or jointly with someone. \n \nGenerally only a court appointed fiduciary can change ownership on he Deed. The fiduciary is appointed by the court on petition of the person who wants that role. A fiduciary is appropriate whether or not there is a Will. The fiduciary is obligated to follow the terms of the Will or the laws of intestacy. \n \nWithout more information about the meters, I cannot say what is needed. Generally action should be taken to preserve the house, which likely would include keeping the electricity at least on until the ownership is settled. The cost  for doing that would be chargeable to the estate.'}
