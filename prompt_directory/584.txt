{'question': 'Does this only apply to renal spaces or does this also apply to owned spaces with the owner living in the space?Referring to - 2006 New York Code - Unlawful Eviction - 26-521 Unlawful eviction', 'answer': 'Very likely yes. It&#039;s not about whether the landlord/owner is living in the building or space. It&#039;s about whether you are lawfully occupying the dwelling unit, has a valid lease, etc. If you are a lawful occupant, then any attempt by the owner/landlord to evict you for not-legally justifiable grounds will be illegal. You may want to ensure, however, that you are in compliance with the terms and conditions of the lease (i.e. not using the space for something unauthorized or illegal, etc).'}
