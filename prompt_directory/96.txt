{'question': 'My mom passed 2019, no will. Court appointed brother executor , sold house 32,000 value was 101,000 still no moneyHe emptied her bank account. Paid taxes late making fines, harassed beneficiaries, no record of accounting may 2021 house sold 1/3 value he never has assessor come in., what can husband and daughter do now ?', 'answer': 'Based on your post, you are clearly confused about the case.  An executor is in a will by definition.  Thus, the statement there is &quot;no will&quot; and the brother is &quot;executor&quot; is legally inconsistent.  I am not sure what happened here by your post.  Is an &quot;assessor&quot; an appraiser or a government official?  You need to talk to a lawyer and bring the papers you have already.  I cannot tell if anything is wrong.'}
