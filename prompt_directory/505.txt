{'question': 'What rights do I have as a renter during the pandemic?I am locked into a lease until August. Recently, my household income has taken a huge hit due to reduced hours worked and wages earned, and we are struggling to make ends meet. I have always made payments early and have a great history with this company. I contacted my landlord and explained the situation. I was told that nothing can be done and that the full rent is due the 1st of the month. What are my options? I know there is a moratorium for evictions, but what about my credit score? And will I really be sued if I have to break my lease?', 'answer': 'Residential or commercial?  If commercial, apply for Federal loans that pay for rent.  Either way, there are no evictions for 90 days, at which point, we should all be back in business.'}
