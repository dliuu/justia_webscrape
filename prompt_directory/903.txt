{'question': 'Are unclaimed heritage something thrustfull?An American Lawyer contacted me to say that they found out I have an unclaimed heritage (I&#039;m Italian) by a aunt that died almost 20 years ago. They didn&#039;t gave me too much details but they made the last name of my grandmother. They told me the state of new york holds the money of the unclaimed heritage and that they made researches and found out I&#039;m a rightful heir. I wanted to know if this is possible or a scam, I wanted to know for how long one can claim an unclaimed estate after the death of the person in the state of new york. They want me to sign a paper where I tell that I will fully collaborate with them  (and that they will get a part of the money ONLY if I get my money) before showing me the documents that prove what they&#039;re saying (so that I can&#039;t act on my own). Also they told me that this is not definitive and that I can still decide not to proceed before sign the power of attorney. Can I thrust them?', 'answer': 'Go to the following website. Search for the relative and follow the procedures to file a claim.  You will need documentation showing your relationship to the decedent. You may need to hire a genealogist.  \n \nhttps://www.osc.state.ny.us/unclaimed-funds'}
