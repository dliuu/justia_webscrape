{'question': 'few questions about what I can do to prevent my siblings from selling parents house in puerto rico without my consentParents lived in PR for 25 yrs, my daughter and I visited a few times/year. 5 kids left house, Im only one that wants to keep it, because I was only one with a relationhip with parents. sister told me yesterday, atty quit, she&#039;s paying taxes which isnt true, and a friends daughter in house free for 2 yrs and now pays 300/mo which was told went to atty. She doesnt want to buy it, and Its time for us to get in and get my parents things, fix the roof, and airbb it til majority rules on selling. Unaware of no atty, the 2 sibs that want 0 to do with it, have taken over. I have been requesting for a year now to give girl notice to leave and family is ready to get involved. my daughter and I would like to have a moment to enjoy the place and go through their things and fix it up. They are ignoring my requests to get into our house. Can I go forward and speak with this girl myself and head down to PR? If so, what if she calls my sister and she tells her that she doesn&#039;t have to leave?', 'answer': 'You do not say whether your parents are alive or not.  Either way, the property is in Puerto Rico so you need to speak with a lawyer there.'}
