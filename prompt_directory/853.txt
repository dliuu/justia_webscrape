Courts are not accepting new proceedings at this time. However, you should start taking action to prepare notices (known as predicate notices) required by law so that you can commence the action right away. Relevant provisions of law you should review are Real Property Law Sections 235 and 711. This list is not exhaustive of all steps you need to take to commence a case.'}
