{'question': 'Landlord is extending next door store. I spent $$ to purchase my store. What terms to negotiate when ending lease earlyLandlord is extending the store next to mine in the building she owns. I spent a huge amount of money when I bought the store. What terms should I negotiate as the landlord is pushing me to end the lease early? Thank you.', 'answer': 'To be assured that the landlord will actually fulfill its obligations under any agreement you reach, a surrender agreement should be drafted and signed.  This type of agreement can be drafted to require the landlord put any payment to be made to you into escrow with a third party (usually your attorney) before you take any steps to shut down your business.  This protects you from being placed in the position of having shut down and the landlord changes its mind.  You can even ask for the landlord to pay/reimburse your legal fees.'}
