{'question': 'Hi my grandmother is the only survivor of her siblings and parents. How can we find out how much land pertains to her?Currently some family members have built houses on the land. We would like to find out how much land she would currently have? We like to built on the land as well. Not sure where to start? Or how much this would all cost. We have asked some family members but no one seems to know anything. Thank you for your help.', 'answer': 'Greetings: \n \nYou would need to ascertain who is the vested owner of the property by having a &quot;last deed search&quot; run. Once you are in receipt of the deed, this will reflect who is the &quot;of record&quot; owner of the property. If it is discovered that the land is currently owned by someone who is now deceased, you would need to see if this person had a Will that dictated to whom ownership of the property would pass too upon their demise. If no formal Will or testementary provisions were made, then the &quot;Intestate Statute&quot; would apply..whereby spouses, issue, etc. would be entitled to ownership of the property as &quot;heirs at law&quot;. \n \n*****This response is generic by necessity and not to be construed as legal advice; and does not create an attorney/client relationship.'}
