{'question': 'How long does it take a lender to find substitute Administrator ?The property is in Brooklyn . My father was the only person on the mortgage. When I was added to his deed , I was recorded as the Administrator. I only found out recently that I needed court papers to become an Administrator, which is what I am trying to do now. I donâ€™t know why I was ever recorded as the Admin so I hired a surrogate attorney who filed everything for me. But surrogate court is moving slow.  How long in kings county does it take a lender to find a substitute Administrator? Thank you', 'answer': 'The lender does not find an administrator; rather the lender needs to obtain jurisdiction over whoever is vested with title to the property the lender is seeking to foreclose by substituting and serving them with process.'}
