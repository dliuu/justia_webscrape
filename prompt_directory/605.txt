{'question': 'I entered into a contract with a company to sell my property to them but have not heard back. What are my options?As the sale date nears i have not heard from them about my payment. Can i make them honor the contract?', 'answer': 'Yes, you can. Your first option is to serve them a Time of the Essence (&quot;TOE&quot;) notice, which gives them the 30 days to close. Your next option, is to sue them for specific performance which would force them to close per the terms of the contract.'}
