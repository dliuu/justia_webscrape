{'question': 'Is it legal for my landlord to use a window (not open) to enter my home while we are away? \nHe lost his keyThis is an email the landlord sent while I was away. Is this legal to do for him? The reason is that he have lost his key. \n \n&quot;We did test the boiler for the third time this morning and it started up without hesitation.  I left the heat on so it should be warm when you arrive.  I did have to find a way into your house through the front kitchen window - sorry but I had no choice as the thermostat had to be calibrated. And sorry again as I left some dirt in the kitchen.&quot;', 'answer': 'In NYC landlords are required to obtain the tenant&#039;s consent to enter an apartment for a non-emergency reason.  The method of entry is not defined.'}
