{'question': 'How can I get forfeited security deposit back (more details below)?I applied for a New York apartment, it was accepted, and I paid the security deposit. The application states that the security is forfeited after 2 weeks if a lease is not signed. This was on March 17th. We had agreed I could sign the lease in mid-April (no exact date). I had decided to go with a different apartment (19 days later, counting non-business days), but to my understanding, the two weeks would begin 14 days before signing the lease, since there was no agreed upon date. Is there a loophole I could find?', 'answer': 'They are illegally holding your security deposit as there is no such thing. Depending on the amount of the security deposit you should consider engaging an attorney on this as youâ€™ve definitely been wronged.'}
